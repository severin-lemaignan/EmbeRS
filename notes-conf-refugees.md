Good talk b Sarah Hunt (Uni Leicester)

-   Participatory Action Research (\"From voice to agency\", Rodriguez
    and Brown 2009)

-   focus on post-migratory risk factors to mental health

-   hceck photo of litterature review

-   check participatory methodology (photos of slides)

-   3 themes emerging from her research: understanding trauma; need for
    responsive/individualised pathways; need for housing + basic needs
    provisions

-   she mention lack of privacy in some provided housing as a permanent
    threat and a source of stress/trauma: **relation to privacy by
    design**

-   point out the need to support not only the children but also the
    schools

-   reference to World Awarness Children in Trauma Model (WACIT,
    Vostanis 2012-2018)

-   example of social integration issues: lack of knowledge of school
    rules (like raising ones' hands, perceived as bad
    behaviours/threatening behaviour); difficulty to meet with peers

-   point raised about need for refugee children to 'fit in a new
    identity, matching local norms/expectation, at the cost of the
    previous, original identity -\> source of suffering: importance of
    *securing identity*, as done by some schools (example of school
    inviting parents of diverse background to come and cook home dishes
    at school, with different background every week)

Prof Ravi Kohli (child welfare):

-   Safety \<-\> belonging \<-\> success (cf photo)

-   \...but not a straight line! Comes and go!

-   underline the need by refugees to reciprocate

-   make a strong point on individual identities instead of being just a
    label (cf photo)

-   **importance of individual stories**

Powerful presentation by Bobby Lloyds; she stayed 2 days/week for 4
years in Calais camp; visual artist + art therapist; large archive of
field experience on Facebook account (ArtRefuge UK)

She points out the importance of mobile phones -\> communication, story
telling, etc

Talk Lucy Arnsby-Wilson:

-   \"how can we help people to feel fully alive?\"

-   a couple of examples of cultural differences (cf photo 'Rights and
    autonomy')

-   mental safety at the end of the interaction: \"will you remember
    me?\"

Talk Katheryn Cronin (lawyer, really interesting, might be worth
contacting her for feedback if we go the 'robot collecting stories'
route)

-   \"process if requesting refugee status is highly destructive\"

-   importance of the narration, story when facing home office/judge

-   **robot to collect *individual* stories and print them out as
    testimonies**: could be useful to help children to build up their
    case

-   often the story (\"dad abducted by talibans, mum fearing for child,
    send child away\") is heard again and again by judges, they
    automatically dismiss it as being a lie based on a 'template'
    provided by smugglers

-   the children often lack the skillset required to tell their stories
    as they come from small villages where everyone know everyone (-\>
    no need to ever tell own story)

-   children also struggle to communicate/explain misunderstandings to
    judge due to different realities: eg: no street light in Afghanistan
    village, so child could hide from taliban raid. Hard to believe for
    UK judge, but the child does not understand why it is hard to
    believe as he does not know that every single street/house would
    have lights in the UK

-   she mention the type of room (light, airy, placement of chairs, etc)
    to avoid reproducing the sense of oppression experienced by the
    children during their journey (eg locked in the back of a lorry)

-   refugee convention is about assessing vulnerability of children if
    they were to return -\> most of the interviews while requesting
    asylum is about assessing/measuring weaknesses/vulnerabilities
    instead of their strength/resilience while they travelled the world.
    Harsh. need to 'train' the children to talk about their
    vulnerabilities.

-   'is their story tainted by smugglers'? question of how genuine the
    story is. Use of robot to disclose their stories?

-   example of Afgani children often told to claim their parents are
    dead or disappeared as they are told it could help them getting
    refugee status. Counter productive (because create inconsistencies
    in their stories) + traumatic

-   importance of the sense of security \<-\> trust -\> robot needs to
    by trustworthy **high level of privacy, control; privacy by design**

-   under EU law, children must receive support to reconnect with their
    families, but almost nothing is done. Could robots help by sharing
    stories online? (potential privacy landfield, though)

Imran Shah: interpretation business. Might be an interesting contact if
we develop multi-lingual capabilities.
