%and most comprehensive advanced robotics research establishment in the
%UK. It is a joint venture between the University of the West of England
%and the University of Bristol. BRL's multidisciplinary approach aims to
%create autonomous devices capable of working independently, with each
%other, or with humans. BRL draws on robotics, electrical \& mechanical
%engineering, computer science, psychology, cognitive science and
%sociology. BRL has an international reputation as a leading research
%centre in advanced robotics research and has over 250 researchers
%working on a broad portfolio of topics: HRI, collective robotics, aerial
%robotics, neuro-inspired control, haptics, control systems, energy
%harvesting and self-sustaining systems, rehabilitation robotics, soft
%robotics and biomedical systems. BRL has many collaboration
%partnerships, both national and international, and is experienced in
%managing large multi-site projects. BRL has support from two embedded
%units specialising in business and enterprise, together with an
%incubator and successful track record of spin-outs.
