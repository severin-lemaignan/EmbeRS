WizMe
=====


WizMe is a project that aims at helping to build strong human relationships with the
help of technology.

The core idea of the project is to build small companion robots whose aim is to
facilitate human-human interactions. We want to develop these robots with a
particular application in mind: supporting the social and cultural integration
of vulnerable children in a foreign country, and in particular, migrant children
who might lack the otherwise needed support for a successful integration.

A robot is left with the child when he or she starts their journey in their new
host country, and becomes a companion for the child during the first months of
the integration. Critically, the robot is designed to support the
social and cultural integration of the child. Using several mechanisms that are
discussed in this proposal, the robot helps the child to gain self-confidence,
and ultimately engage in successful social interactions with other children.

The project combines a range of scientific and engineering endeavours to realise
within a 5-years timeframe an ambitious and bold vision for social robotics in
our society. Specifically, the project draws from the fields of social robotics;
human-robot interaction; human-machine interaction design; and mechatronics.
While the breadth of the proposed project is significant (from mechatronic
design to long-term field testing with vulnerable populations), the project structure
minimizes the cross-dependencies within the project, avoiding critical
failure points that would endanger the whole project, and a careful risk
assessment is conducted that includes meaningful mitigation strategies
