Knowlingly or not, AI is part of our daily life, from shopping suggestions, to
automated agents that respond our phone calls. Robots are coming next, to deliver
our parcels faster or support our ageing society. Many fears that these
technologies might isolate individuals, and exert further strain on our fragile
social fabric.

Does it have to be the case, though? Could instead a suitably-programmed robot
\textbf{enhance} social interactions between humans? Could social robots become
the tools to build stronger, \textbf{more human-like} bonds and
interactions within our societies? This question is the backbone of
the \project research project.

\project investigates how \textbf{socially-driven} robots can have a lasting, positive
impact on the society, by fostering social interactions amongst humans
themselves. It defines the new concept of \textbf{robot-supported human-human
interactions} as a general framework to study and implement socially-aware
intelligent robots, able to understand social interaction, and, when
appropriate, act to create and support positive interactions between people.

Grounded in both the psycho-social literature of human cognition, and the latest
technological advances in human-robot interaction, the project delivers
major conceptual, technical and experimental contributions to the field of AI, 
with a particular focus on ethics \& safeguarding mechanisms, in order to build 'by 
design' a trustworthy AI system.

\project delivers this programme by building on a range of multidisciplinary
methods, including sociological investigation, novel interactive machine
learning techniques, and a pervasive approach to co-design that puts the
end-user needs at the centre of the design process. It paves the way for a
better understanding of the societal challenges raised by the rapid development
of AI and robotics, and, critically, opens a \textbf{unique window into what
positive role social robots could play in our future societies}.

\section{Long-term vision and targeted breakthrough towards that vision}

\project defines and realises \textbf{a vision of AI and social
robotics that aims at placing the human at the centre of these emerging technologies;
supports stronger, more cohesive social interactions; aims at reinforcing the social
fabric of our societies, rather than isolating individuals}.

This research is ground-breaking: \project introduces the core idea of
\textbf{robot-supported human-human interactions}, which reverses the
traditionally accepted, technology-centric, view on human-robot interactions.
Instead of having the robot at the centre of the stage, we build from
pre-existing social interactions between people, and investigate where, when and
how robots could facilitate and enrich them. This change of paradigm will have
far reaching impact on the place that we collectively assign to social robots in
the society; it will be a key contribution to the public debate by reframing
human-robot interaction in term of social utility.

As such, \project is about researching, defining and implementing the conceptual
framework that we need to ensure trustworthy and socially responsible robots.
However, it is also a highly technical project, who aims at significantly
pushing the state-of-art in autonomous social robotics. Indeed, \project
is also about \textbf{implementing the AI required for robots to
effectively support human social interactions}.

In that sense, this research is also ground-breaking in regards to its technical
objectives. In \project, robots will be able to understand complex social
dynamics, and generate appropriate social responses, in a fully autonomous way.
And, in particular, identifying, implementing, and integrating the required
cognitive functions into a principled, socially-driven, and trustworthy
socio-cognitive architecture for robots is one of the major expected scientific
outcomes of \project.

Beyond the specific outputs of the project, \project is also about asserting and
reinforcing the European leadership in AI and robotics, in a way that is
socially responsible and guarantees, by design, long-term benefits to the
society. This requires strong vision, scientific leadership, and technical
excellence. \textbf{\project aims at building this capacity}. 


\subsection{The case for robot-supported human-human interactions}

Indeed, in a time where robots are on the verge of becoming pervasive in our
daily human environment, can we ensure 'by design' that robots are to become
powerful tools to support more and better, positive interactions \emph{between
the people themselves}, and build a stronger, more cohesive society? Beyond
Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), \project is
a forward-looking, ground-breaking project that aims at establishing
\textbf{Robot-supported Human-Human Interactions (r-HHI)} as the next step
toward a Responsible AI: \textbf{the scientific investigation of how social
robots can create, shape and support strong, sustained, positive
\emph{human-human} relationships}.

As a researcher who has been working for the last 12 years in the field of
human-robot interaction (and child-robot interaction in particular), I have been
a direct witness -- by being one of the architects -- of the crossing of a
critical milestone: the emergence of \textbf{long-term social interactions}
between robots and humans. Over the last two years in particular, we observe an
explosion of the number of studies involving social robots, deployed in
real-world settings (schools, care centres) over relatively long periods of time
(up to 2 or 3 months at a time)~\cite{kunze2018artificial,leite2013social}. Even
though these robots are rarely fully autonomous, they do already show high
levels of autonomy~\cite{senft2019teaching}, with full autonomy in
sight~\cite{hawes2017strands}.

While many see these developments positively,
others express skepticism or worry that this technology might lead to a
dehumanisation of our society. Indeed, if artificial agents are to engage into
social interactions with us, and enter what many view as a form of a 'private
domain', reserved to humans, pressing ethical questions need to be answered:

\begin{itemize}
    \item how to ensure that social robots are not used to simply replace the human
        workforce to cut costs?
    \item can we provide guarantees that the use of social robots will always be
        ethically motivated?
    \item further on, can we implement some ethical safeguarding built-in
        the system (like an ethical \emph{black-box}~\cite{winfield2017case})?
    \item what about privacy? how to trust robots in our home or school or
        hospital not to eavesdrop on our private lives, and, in the worst
        case, not be used \emph{against} us?
\end{itemize}

These questions are not only legitimate, but also pressing. The recent rise of
personal assistants like Amazon Alexa or Google Home, with the major privacy
concerns that accompanies their deployments in people home, shows that letting
the industry set the agenda on these questions is not entirely wise -- and
robots can potentially be much more intrusive than non-mobile smart speakers.
The EU is positioning itself at the forefront of those questions. The recent
release of operational \emph{Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI} by the EU
High-level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence~\cite{eu2019ethics} is a
strong sign of this commitment.  However, personal \& social robots raise a new
class of questions regarding what ethical and trustworthy systems might look
like, and while the principles of responsible design are somewhat
established~\cite{stahl2016ethics, bsi2016robots}, the reality of
robot-influenced social interactions is not understood yet, if only because the
technology required to experience such interactions is only slowly maturing. 

Social robots have indeed two properties that stand out, and distinguish them from
these smart speakers, while making them significantly harder to conceptually frame.
First, they are fully embodied, and they physically interact with their
environment, from moving around, to picking up objects, to looking at you;
second, willingly or not, they are ascribed \emph{agency} by people. This second
difference has far-reaching consequences, from affective bonding to over-trust,
to over-disclosure of personal, possibly sensitive,
informations~\cite{martelaro2016tell,shiomi2017robot}.


Due to the complex interplay between the socio-psychological determinants of the
interactions, the technical implementation, and the multiple ethical mechanisms
that have to be built-in the system, it is difficult to build one coherent and
consistent perspective on the whole question. Indeed, the conceptual,
intellectual framework emcompassing both the internal cognitive mechanisms
required by socially intelligent robots, as well as their role and impact in the
society, only exists in fragmented, disconnected pieces~\cite{citeneeded}.


The lack of such a proper conceptual framing is a critical issue: for robots to
have a positive impact on the society, with strict ethical and privacy-related
safeguarding, it is urgent that the wider academic and intellectual communities,
beyond technologists, embrace this question and build up the debate on the
acceptability of robots in our society. And \textbf{this also calls for a major
re-thinking of the traditional paradigm of Human-Robot Interaction}.
Tradionally, individual cognitive functions (like natural language processing,
emotion recognition, proxemics-aware navigation) are implemented in robots, with
the ill-supported assumption that 'the more available functions, the more
socially-capable the robot'. This assumption is questionable, and, at any rate,
does not address the 'why': why does the robot decides to do what it does? What
drives the behaviour of the robot? The case for \emph{teleological} (ie
goal-driven) robotic architectures has been made in the
past~\cite{wrede2012towards}, but only effectively realised for relatively
simple cognitive systems (like curiosity-driven robot
animals~\cite{oudeyer2005playground} or motor babbling in infant-like
robots~\cite{forestier2017unified}). However, socially-driven robots,
participating in complex interactions with humans, have been barely
investigated. We need to create a new social purpose, a new social teleology to
drive the development of social robots.  Indeed, \textbf{being socially-driven
to do 'good' is essential in ensuring trustworthy, socially responsible robots}.
Nutrured by decades of research in understanding human social cognition and its
social motivations, one of the key purpose of \project is to \textbf{research
and build a principled and socially-driven cognitive architecture} for
tomorrow's social robots. This socially-driven, teleological architecture,
intrinsically designed to \textbf{support stronger, positive human-human
interactions} is what underpins the concept of \emph{robot-supported human-human
interactions}.

\subsection{Operationalising the \project vision}

Socially intelligent robots require unique, beyond state-of-the-art,
capabilities to \emph{(1)} understand the social interactions (social
situation awareness), \emph{(2)} autonomously decide the best course of action for
short-term and longer-term social influence, and \emph{(3)} perform the
appropriate social actions and exert said influence in an appropriate,
responsible manner.

However, extreme complexity hides behind these seemingly well-delineated steps:
not only the required technology is itself beyond state-of-the-art, but the
interplay between technology, socio-cognitive psychology, privacy and ethics is
only starting to be researched and understood. Together, it forms what is called
a \emph{wicked problem}~\cite{tonkinwise2015design} -- a problem whose social complexity
means that it has no clear stopping point. \textbf{\project offers an
strong vision and an ambitious, evidenced-based, methodology to significantly
advance our understanding of this problem}.

Over the course of 5 years, I will specifically investigate the following
research questions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{R1} [conceptual framing]: how the abstract idea of
        \emph{robot-supported human-human interaction} translates into
        (implementable) interaction design principles? what are the determinants
        and parameters of a social intervention, performed by a socially-driven
        robot, to support positive human-human social interactions? How to
        balance social utility and social responsability?

    \item \textbf{R2} [conceptual \& technology level]: how do these principles
        can be integrated into a principled, socially-driven teleological
        architecture for autonomous robots? What additional principles (like
        human-in-the-loop machine learning) need to
        be considered to ensure, \emph{by design}, a responsible, trustworthy,
        human-centered robot behaviour?

    \item \textbf{R3} [technology level]: where are the technological gaps in
        artificial social cognition that prevent the actual realisation of a
        robot capable of effective social support? can we fill them?

    \item \textbf{R4} [experimental level]: can we demonstrate in complex, real
        world conditions, the effectiveness and usefulness of the
        robot-supported human-human interaction paradigm? Can we do so by
        involving the end-users at every stage of the design, implementation and
        testing cycle?

\end{itemize}

\section{Implementation of the work programme}

Indeed, the \project vision unfolds along four main axes, reflected in the
structure of the workpackages: \textbf{WP1} is dedicated to the conceptual
framing of the project (R1); \textbf{WP2} grows from WP2 to transpose the
conceptual framework into a principled cognitive architecture (R2); \textbf{WP3}
and \textbf{WP4} look at the technological underpinnings of this architecture
(R3); and \textbf{WP5} organises the experimental fieldwork that will assess
the effectiveness of the \project approach in three ambitious and complementary
real-world situations (R4).

\paragraph{WP1: \textbf{\wpOne}} (Y1-3)

The basic ambition of \project is to create a conceptual framework around social
robots in the human society, by re-framing the widely accepted, yet sorely
unspecific, idea of \emph{human-robot interaction} into the more specific idea
of \emph{robot-supported human-human interactions} (r-HHI): the robot is
considered from the perspective of how it can \emph{support} humans, and in
particular, support stronger, positive interactions between humans.

\textbf{T1.1 -- Conceptual framing of r-HHI} The first task in WP1 is to research and
define such a framework that will provide the (currently missing) conceptual
frame around questions like: what role for social robots? where to set the
boundaries of artificial social interactions? what does 'ethical-by-design',
'responsible-by-design' might mean in the context of social human-robot
interactions? 

\textbf{T1.2 -- Experimental framing of r-HHI} In order to anchor T1.1 into the
reality and complexity of human social interactions, and to also involve the
civil society in this framing process, T1.2 will embed \project into the 'City
lab' experiment, led by WeTheCurious, Bristol's science museum. WeTheCurious is
leading the push for a new form of public engagement, call 'City Lab', that sees
the visitors engaging in the actual production of science. In Task 1.2, we will
integrate \project in the City Lab to co-design and co-produce robot-supported
social interactions with the general public. For an initial period of one year,
two \project robots will be permanently based at the museum.  Participants
(children and adults) will be guided, with the help of museum staff and a
dedicated interface, into teleoperating the robots to make them good 'social
helpers'.  This will generate the quantitative and qualitative data to inform
questions like 'what role for the robot?', 'when to intervene?', 'what are the
effective and acceptable social influence techniques?'. It will also be a unique
example of large-scale participatory design with future end-users of social
robots.

\textbf{Specific resources} I have an on-going collaboration with WeTheCurious,
and preliminary meetings were held to discuss specific requirements for the
\project project. The museum is very supportive of the project, and will include
\project in its programme of activities.

\textbf{T1.3 -- Determinants and principles of robot-supported social
interactions} The conceptual framework identified in T1.1 and T1.2 is translated into a
set of \emph{interaction design principles}, \emph{determinants} and
\emph{parameters} that will together form a set of requirements and objectives
for the socio-cognitive architecture developed in WP2.

\paragraph{WP2: \textbf{\wpTwo}} (Y2-5)

This part of the programme is the technical core of the project: I will create a
novel socio-cognitive architecture for the robots, bringing together advanced
perception of the human social dynamics, intrinsic motivation to support human
interactions, and human-in-the-loop machine learning to create transparent,
trustworthy action policies. This WP is high-risk/high-gain, as no such combined
approach has been successfully implemented and deployed in real-world, complex
social situations. I mitigate the risk by ensuring cognitive functions are
decoupled from each other where sensible, and in particular, by ensuring that
the robot actions are generated independently through both an intrinsic
motivation mechanism, and a human-taught machine learning action policy, hence
creating a level of cognitive redundancy (with the corresponding arbitration
mechanisms in place where necessary).

\TODO{explain why intrinsic motivation OR human-in-the-loop ML alone are not
sufficient}

\textbf{T2.1 -- Socially-driven architecture} The socio-cognitive architecture
of \project robots is built around two principles: \emph{human-taught autonomy},
and a \emph{social teleology}. This task covers the overall design of the
architecture. It builds from the principles identified in T1.3, and relies on a
combination of socially-driven intrinsic motivation, and human-in-the-loop
machine learning to progressively learn an autonomous social policy.  One
additional outcome of this design stage is a set of required cognitive functions that
informs WP3 and WP4.

\textbf{T2.2 -- Learning from humans to achieve 'by-design' responsible \&
trustworthy AI} Building on my recent, promising results on human-in-the-loop
social learning~\cite{senft2017supervised,senft2019teaching}, this task
implements the learning mechanics (including the critical aspect of the
interface with the human teacher) to allow human participants to progressively
teach the robot a social policy to become a good social helper. This task also
researches whether and how human-in-the-loop machine learning enables a more
trustworthy AI system, by involving the end-users in the creation of the robot
behaviours.

\textbf{T2.3 -- Hybrid situation assessment and knowledge representation}
Knowledge representation and
grounding is a fundamental building block for cognitive
architectures~\cite{lemaignan2017artificial}. This task builds on existing
state-of-art in knowledge representation (eg~\cite{lemaignan2010oro}) and
situation assessment (eg~\cite{sallami2019simulation}) and creates a
coherent and hybrid (symbolic/sub-symbolic) system of representations for the cognitive architecture.

\paragraph{WP3: \textbf{\wpThree}} (Y1-4)

In WP3, the project addresses the key scientific and technical pre-requisites to
effectively deliver WP2's architecture:  the scientific understanding and
formalisation of the \emph{social fabric} in which the robot is embedded, in its
full complexity: spatial characteristics (proxemics; group dynamics; complex,
dynamic attentional mechanisms); psycho-social determinants (social roles and
hierarchies; social groups; mental modelling; anthropomorphic ascriptions);
temporal characteristics (effects of novelty; dynamics of anthropomorphism and
mental ascriptions; group dynamics).  While some of these capabilities have been
previously investigated is isolation~\cite{citeneeded}, this WP will deliver the
first complete and integrated model of artificial social cognition.

\textbf{T3.1 -- Social dynamics}

\TODO{}

\textbf{T3.2 -- Interaction dynamics}

\TODO{}

\textbf{T3.3 -- Social situation assessment} The integration of the social cues
from T3.1 and T3.2 results in a socio-cognitive model of the social environment
of the robot that we term \emph{social situation assessment}.  It effectively
extends the representation capabilities of T2.3 to the social sphere, and covers
the development of a complete social assessment pipeline, from social signal
perception (like automatic attention tracking, face recognition, sound
localisation, etc.) to higher-level socio-cognitive constructs, including group
dynamics and theory of mind. This will rely on hybrid AI techniques, including
symbolic (ontologies and first-order logic), sub-symbolic (neural nets) and
hybrid (conceptors) modelling.


\paragraph{WP4: \textbf{\wpFour}} (Y1-4)

\TODO{Split into tasks}

Mirroring WP3, WP4 addresses the question of social behaviour \emph{generation}.
Indeed, designing behaviours that enable sustained, long-term engagement in a
social human-robot interaction is essentially an open research question. Three
main approaches to social behaviours generation exist today:
\emph{user-induced}, where the end-user interacts with the robot and ascribes
(knowingly or not) complex behaviours to the machine, while in reality the
robot's behaviours are simple and non-goal oriented (eg generating a noise or a
small movement when being touched). This has been used to great effect in
therapy robots, for instance (eg Paro). \emph{Off-the-shelf behaviours}, where
the robot relies on a set library of behaviours (that might be individually
relatively complex). The approach can elicit a strong initial social response
from the user, but this social response tends to vanish rapidly once the
'tricks' of the robot have been all discovered and become repetitive.  Besides,
as the robot does not typically maintain a long-term socio-cognitive plan of the
interaction, the behaviours are typically perceived as fun, yet pointless. This
is often observed in toy-like robots (eg Vector, Dot \& Dash). Finally, many
social robots avoid altogether the problem of generating behaviours by simply
offering to the end-user control over \emph{low-level behaviours} (eg, control
of the joints of the robot). This means that, even when the robot has relatively
powerful social perception capabilities (like recognising people and voice), no
real social behaviours is generated.

None of these three approach is satisfactory, and indeed, no approach to date
has been able to engage human users in long-term, sustained interactions.
\project aims at significantly advancing the state of the art in this regard, by
combining two emerging techniques: (1) a new data-driven, continuous approach to
behaviour generation inspired by Learning from
Demonstration~\cite{citationneeded}; (2) interactive machine learning in
high-dimensional input/output spaces~\cite{senft2020woz}, where I have shown
with my students promising results for generating complex social
behaviours~\cite{senft2019teaching, winkle2020coach} that fully involve the
end-users~\cite{winkle2020methodology}. By combining the two, \textbf{I target a
breakthrough in robots' social behaviours generation: the generation of
non-repetitive, socially congruent and transparent social
behaviours} (including gestures and gazes).

\TODO{discuss Liveliness (Pepper/Nao), Curiosity-based (\cite{kaplan}),
human-in-the-loop (\cite{senft, winkle})}

\paragraph{WP5: \textbf{\wpFive}} (Y2-5)

WP5 aims at convincingly demonstrating the importance and positive impact of
socially-driven, socially-responsible robotics may have. The experimental work
of \project will be organised around two ambitious long-term studies (in
addition to the museum study, T1.2), in complex, real-world environments: a
network of special needs schools, and the Bristol Children Hospital.

These environments also put the project in the unique position of actually
delivering high societal impact: besides the thousands of people that will
contribute to the design of the system at the museum, we anticipate 100+
hospitalised children with long-term conditions, and about 350\TODO{check with
Nigel} SEN-educated children to directly benefit from the project, showing how
robots can have a lasting, strong, positive impact on the society, also
establishing the idea of \emph{robots supporting human interactions} instead of
dehumanising our social relationships.

\textbf{T5.2 -- creation and deployment of a robot companion to
support physical and mental well-being, as well as foster social interactions,
in SEN schools} This task aims at demonstrating robot-supported social
interventions within the eco-system of SEN (Special Educational Needs)
schools. The aim is to effectively support the day-to-day work of the
school staff to support the development, learning and well-being of the
children. A \project robot will be deployed for several months in a
Bristol-based SEN school (to be possibly extended to additional schools) to
investigate how an autonomous social robot can help shaping a spatial and social
school ecology that fosters mental well-being, while effectively supporting
student-student and student-teacher social interactions. The
robot behaviours will be co-designed with the teachers, the students, and the
parents through several preliminary design workshops

\textbf{Specific resources} this task will take place within a network of
Bristol-based SEN schools, with which I already have on-going collaborations
(child-robot interaction for children with autism at Bristol's Mendip School).
The task will be jointly supervised with local colleague and expert Dr. Newbutt,
who has a long track record of working with special needs schools.


\textbf{T5.3 -- creation and deployment of a small robot companion to support
isolated children during their hospital stay}, fully integrated and aware of the
wider hospital ecosystem


\textbf{Specific resources} this task will take place at the Bristol Children
Hospital. Several preparatory meetings already took place with the head of the
hospital education service J. Bowyer, who will support the project, giving me
access to two of the long-term conditions wards for the duration of the studies.



\subsection{Capacity of the Principal Investigator to deliver on the work programme}

The project's ambitious scientific and technical goals are expected to deliver
major scientific, societal and technical impact, that extends beyond the end of
the fellowship. At the end of the fellowship, the PI is expected to be a
world-leader in the emerging field of socially-driven, responsible autonomous
service \& companion robots. This leadership is required to address and inform
policies related to the key emerging societal challenge of AI and intelligent
robots.

PI Lemaignan is in a unique position to deliver on the \project work plan.  He
has already established international recognition in human-robot interaction and
has likewise demonstrated strong leadership by leading research teams in three
different institutions (see Sections B1.b and B1.c). Importantly, as
illustrated in Table~\ref{pi-expertise}, the breadth of
his interdiscplinary research covers the scientific expertise required by the
project, providing him with a unique overall perspective and understanding of
the domain. PI Lemaignan is also a technology expert, with major software and
hardware contributions to the robotic community (see Section B1.c).

While ambitious, the project's feasibility is ensured through a strong
combination of cross-disciplinary expertise and support from the host's unique
research infrastructure. Scaffolded by a participatory and iterative research
methodology, and the PI experience in managing teams and complex projects
through his recognised leadership, \project is set to deliver.

To mirror the cross-disciplinary team, the research methodology developped for
\project will rely heavily on \emph{mutual shaping}, through co-design and
participatory design, and multi-disciplinary development sprints.

\eu{(max 2 pages)}

Since my joint PhD in Cognitive Robotics from the CNRS/LAAS (France) and the
Technical University of Munich (Germany), for which I received the \emph{Best
PhD in Robotics 2012} award from French CNRS and the prized \emph{Cumma Summa
Laude} distinction in Germany, I have emerged as a leading authority in
Human-Robot Interaction.

Soon after my PhD, I initiated and successfully led for 2 years the HRI group
within the AI for Learning CHILI Lab at EPFL (Switzerland), supervising in total
10 students, and creating in a short timeframe an internationally visible centre
of excellence in educational robotics. While my original training was in
\textbf{symbolic cognition \& AI, and software engineering for autonomous
robotics}, my postdoctoral stay at the highly cross-disciplinary CHILI Lab gave
me the opportunity to develop my expertise in \textbf{experimental sciences,
socio-psychology and education sciences}.

I then engaged in more basic research on artificial cognition during my MSCA
Individual Fellowship: during 2 years, I explored the underpinnings of
artificial social cognition. I \textbf{contributed significantly to the framing
of the emerging field of data-driven HRI}, also releasing of the PInSoRo open
dataset (\href{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1043507}{10.5281/zenodo.1043507}),
a \textbf{one-in-a-kind dataset of child-child and child-robot social
interactions}.

My current role as a permanent senior researcher at the Bristol Robotics
Laboratory (largest co-located robotic lab in the UK) is a leadership role. I am
\textbf{in charge of defining and implementing the lab's research strategy in
human-robot interactions}. I co-lead both the (recently created) Embedded
Cognition for Human-Robot Interactions (ECHOS) research group (15+ PhDs and
post-docs), as well as the Connected Autonomous Vehicles research group (5
students and post-docs). Specifically, the ECHOS group covers most aspects of
situated AI for human-robot interaction, \textbf{my role includes strategic
planning of the group activities, scientific guidance, recruitment of staff and
prospective students, and grant applications}.

My field of expertise covers \textbf{the socio-cognitive aspects of
human-robot interaction, both from the perspective of the human cognition and
the design and implementation of cognitive architectures for robots}. I have
also focused a significant portion of my \textbf{experimental work on
child-robot interactions in real-world educative settings}, exploring how robots
can support teachers and therapists to develop effective and engaging novel
learning paradigms.

This expertise is recognised internationally: I have a substantial track record
of academic outputs (since 2008, I have authored or co-authored \textbf{75+ peer-reviewed
publications} in international journals and conferences, leading to \textbf{2100+
citations}, h-index of 24, i10-index of 38 (source: Google Scholar).

I have established strong \textbf{peer recognition} in the field of human-robot interaction
and cognitive robotics. For instance:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]
    \item invited to \textbf{high-profile editorial roles}: Programme Committee member of the HRI
conference since 2015; editor of Frontiers In Robotics and AI journal; editor or
Programme Committee member of several leading conferences in AI and Robotics (IROS, IJCAI, HAI, AAMAS);
    \item invited member of the UK EPSRC Associate Peer Review College;
    \item numerous \textbf{invited talks} at national and international symposiums and
        events (9 invited talks since Jan. 2018, including \textbf{keynotes} at the UK Robotics
and Autonomous Systems 2019 conference, and at the 2018 AAAI Fall Symposium);
    \item local \textbf{organiser for the high-profile, international HRI2020
        conference};
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Research dissemination}

I \textbf{actively engage with policy makers, at national and European
level}: for instance, over the past 2 years, I have been directly interacting
(through participating to panels, visits and one-to-one discussions) with the EU
Research Executive Agency (MSCA AI Cluster 2019); the UK minister for Business,
Energy and Industrial Strategy Greg Clark; the UK minister for Universities,
Science, Research and Innovation Chris Skidmore; the chair of the West of
England authority Tim Bowles; the UK Research \& Innovation (UKRI) Portfolio
manager for Robotics Clara Morri.


I also actively engage in research communication: my past research has been
covered several times by mainstream international media, including press
releases by Reuters, Press Association; TV coverage by the BBC, Sky News; radio
interviews and broacast. My academic website (\url{academia.skadge.org})
showcases this media coverage. I also maintain an active, science-focused, presence on the social
media (Twitter handle: @skadge)

\project aims at building unique European capacity to assert leadership in this
domain, and, beyond the specific deliverables of this 5-years project,
establishing the PI as a world-leader in goal-driven, socially-responsible
robotics.


While the original aspiration to a
'multi-function-household-robot-that-does-the-dishes' has yet to materialise --
physical manipulation of objects in an unstructured environment is hard, as it
happens --, social robots are certainly in the process of establishing
themselves as important agents in a variety of other situations, for their
intrinsic \emph{social} features: source of comfort, tutors, entertainers. The
robot as a \emph{social agent} is a reality, within laboratories at least.


\subsection{Three pillars}

To achieve the vision of a natural and harmonious \emph{co-habitation} between
social robots and humans, ...

The \project project will, for the first time, take a broad, holistic approach
to these questions, and as such, is build around three pilars:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item AI architecture for decision making
    \item socio-psychological design of the interaction, from 1-to-1
        interaction, to group interaction, to interaction with the eco-system
    \item built-in privacy and ethics
\end{enumerate}

The difficulty comes from the fact that these pilars do not represent independent
research questions: they are deeply woven together, in intricate ways.


Taken independently, these three pilars are already intrinsically complex.

The first pilar, AI Architecture for Decision Making, for instance:
state-of-the-art decision making processes for social robots are build from
multiple algorithmic layers: classical machine learning (like classifiers, or
SLAM) for low-level sensori-motor processing; probabilistic data processing (for
e.g. localisation or point cloud processing); deep neural networks for object
recognition, scene understanding, speech and dialogue processing; classical
symbolic reasoning (for instance, for task planning); high-level knowledge
representation and reasoning (semantic webs); hybrid spatial/symbolic reasoning
for motion planning; etc.

Importantly, these layers are not typically combined in a simple, linear
fashion: modern control architectures are distributed, loosely coupled, and
design so that information flows in multiple directions, at different levels of
abstraction, in order to create complex feedback loops, and achieve systems that are
both goal-directed \emph{and} reactive (event-driven).


The real complexity of such AI architectures is however striking when one tries
to answer \emph{how} such an architecture can enable the realisation of the
desired socio-cognitive functions, i.e. our second pilar. Social behaviours and
social situations are highly dynamic, loosely structured, underspecified (no
pre-made rulebook exists), uncertain.

Our best answer is for the robot to learn to become social: a human expert teaches
the robot how to socially behave, in-situ, with the robot embedded in the
interaction. I have conducted two recent and high-profile experiments in this
direction

\subsection{Small robot for refugee children}
This second application scenario is about using a small, social, friendly robot
to help refugee children to turn the complex experience of their journey across
the world into a powerful story that they will be able to show and tell while
seeking asylum.

The robot (while the exact platform is yet to be decided, it will likely be
similar to the Bluefrog's Buddy or Asus' Zenbo) will be used by field
practitioners (primarily by ArtRefuge UK, with possible extensions to other
charities and NGOs) in refugee camps and safe-houses across Europe to support
the children. Supported by the staff, the robot and the child engage into a
non-threatening social interaction, in which the child is invited, little by
little, to recount her/his journey and personal life. The duration and frequency
of the interventions is flexible and would be tailored to each child's needs;
over the course of one to three weeks, we would typically envision one 30-min
long interaction every day.

Following the ArtRefuge approach, as well as the interactions created by ChloÃ©
Meineck on her previous Trove project\footnote{\url{https://bit.ly/2ZlZL5W}},
the child is invited to tell her/his story in many different way, using a
variety of supports: narration, drawings, paintings, plasticine, small toy
figures, etc.  The robot records (pictures, videos, sounds) these
representations, and also actively engage with the child, showing curiosity,
non-judgmental emotional responses, and nudging the child to tell more, show
more.

Critically, while the robot will be able to understand and record the textual
transcription of the what the child says (multi-lingual speech recognition),
the robot itself is purposefully designed *not* to speak, using instead *non-verbal*
communication mechanisms (non-verbal utterances using sounds, gaze, joint
attention, expressive motions, etc). In particular, the *soundscape* of the
robot will be designed by Dave Meckin, an expert on sound design for vulnerable
children. The purpose is to create an approachable, non-threatening,
non-judgmental, *social* interaction with the child, and effectively establish
the interaction into a trusted physical and emotional *safe-space* for the
child.

The work will initially focus on one-to-one interactions, and might evolve
towards interactions with small groups (2-3) of children if deemed desirable
after the first field deployments.

Another critical aspect of the project relates to how the robot will store and
protect the potentially highly sensitive data that is recorded during the
interactions. Data will only be stored on the robot itself (no external cloud
storage), and records will be strongly encrypted (i.e. even if the robot is
seized, the data will not be accessible). We will research secure, yet
child-friendly, mechanisms to identify the child and ensure that only her/him
can access her/his personal data. This will likely involve a combination of
picture-based passwords and facial recognition.

The created digital record will ultimately belong to the child. We will research
and create practical means (paper copy, bracelet with a SD card,...) for the
child to access this record when he needs it, and take it with her/him, even
after she/he has left the camp or safe-house. The devised solution will have to
ensure that no abuse or misuse of the record against the child is possible.

\subsection{The long-term vision: robot-supported human-human interactions}


\begin{figure}[!htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figs/render5-colors.png}
\end{figure}

\project is a project that aims at helping to build strong human
relationships with the help of technology.

The core idea of the project is to build small companion robots whose
aim is to facilitate human-human interactions. We want to develop these
robots with a particular application in mind: supporting the social and
cultural integration of vulnerable children in a foreign country, and in
particular, migrant children who might lack the otherwise needed support
(shared culture; already well integrated relatives) for a successful
integration.

\subsubsection{Key scientific research questions}

\begin{enumerate}
\item research the role of social influence to scaffold positive human-human
    interactions (including its ethical ramifications) in the context of migrant
    integration;
\item explore how a small robot companion can be endowed with social
    competencies to positively influence human interactions; design and
    implement the corresponding artificial social behaviours;
\item design and build a small rugged and autonomous companion robot that
    realise this goal for child-child interactions; test the technology in
    school with actual migrant children.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Vision of a novel form of interaction ``human-(robot)-human''}

\paragraph{The case of the social integration of migrant children}

A robot is left with the child when he or she starts their journey in
their new host country, and becomes a companion for the child during the
first months of the integration. Using several mechanisms that are
discussed in this proposal, the robot helps the child to gain
self-confidence, and ultimately engage in successful social interactions
with other children.

Critically, the robot is designed to support the social and cultural
integration of the child \emph{amongst her/his peers}. While the child
might build affective/emotional bonds with the robot over the course of
the support period, the robot behaviour is designed to ensure that these
bonds do not substitute themselves to the interactions with other
children.

The project combines a range of scientific and engineering endeavours to
realise within a 5-years timeframe an ambitious and bold vision for
social robotics in our society. Specifically, the project draws from the
fields of social robotics; human-robot interaction; human-machine
interaction design; and mechatronics.

While the breadth of the proposed project is significant (from
mechatronic design to long-term field testing with vulnerable
populations), the project structure minimizes the cross-dependencies
within the project, avoiding critical failure points that would put the
whole project at risk, and a careful risk assessment is conducted that
includes meaningful mitigation strategies.

\section{Social robots in the society}

\subsection{Psycho-social underpinnings}

Developing a conceptual framework for \emph{robot-supported human-human
interactions} implies a deep understanding of the psycho-social mechanisms at
work in human-human interactions, and in human-robot interactions.

Anthropomorphism is a psychological mechanism by which a human
ascribe human traits to non-human artefacts (here, robots): while the
robot appearance and behaviour can elicit or reinforce these ascription,
it fundamentally originate in the human her/himself~\cite{fink}.


\paragraph{A support for shared understanding}

\emph{Computer Supported Collaborative Learning} (CSCL) researches the cognitive
mechanisms and practical techniques underpinning efficient learning in social
situations. From its very beginning, CSCL research has been following
Roschelle and Teasley's suggestion~\cite{roschelle1995construction} that
collaborative learning has something to do with the process of constructing and
maintaining a \emph{shared understanding} of the task at hand. Building a shared/mutual
understanding refers to the upper class of collaborative learning situations,
those in which students should build upon each other's understanding to refine
their own understanding.  What is expected to produce learning is not the mere
fact that two students build the same understanding but the cognitive effort
they have to engage to build this shared
understanding~\cite{schwartz1995emergence}.

The construction of a shared understanding has been investigated for several
years in psycholinguistics, under the  notion of \emph{grounding}\footnote{Note
that the meaning of \emph{grounding} -- ensuring a shared understanding of a
situation during an interaction -- that we employ in this article must be
distinguished from its meaning in the context of \emph{symbol grounding} as
defined by Harnad~\cite{harnad1990symbol}.}~(Clark,
in~\cite{clark1986referring}).  However, the relevance of grounding mechanisms
for explaining learning outcomes has been questioned in learning sciences. The
monitoring and repair of misunderstanding explains for instance referential
failures in short dialogue episodes but does hardly predict \emph{conceptual
change} (ie the acquisition, acceptation and integration of a new belief into
one's mental model) over longer
sessions~\cite{dillenbourg2006sharing}. The cumulative effect of grounding
episodes can probably be better understood from a socio-cultural perspective:

\begin{quote}
Collaborative learning is associated with the increased
cognitive-interactional effort involved in the transition from \emph{learning to
understand each other} to \emph{learning to understand the meanings of the semiotic
tools that constitute the mediators of interpersonal
interaction}~\cite{baker1999role}
\end{quote}

Along this line, several scholars suggest that CSCL research should go deeper in
the understanding of how partners engage into shared meaning
making~\cite{stahl2007meaning} or \emph{intersubjective} meaning
making~\cite{suthers2006technology}.

Paradoxically, while Clark's theory is somewhat too linguistic from a conceptual
change viewpoint, it is criticized at the same time as being too cognitivist by
some psycholinguists, ie as overestimating the amount of shared knowledge and
mutual representations actually necessary to conduct a dialogue. The fundamental
issue, as old as philosophy, is the degree of coupling between the different
levels of dialogue, mostly between the lexical/syntactical level and the deeper
semantic levels. In~\cite{pickering2006alignment}, Pickering and Garrod argue
that the mutual understanding starts mostly with a \emph{superficial alignment}
at the level of the linguistic representations, due to priming mechanisms, and
that this local alignment may -- in some cases -- lead to a \emph{global
alignment} of the semantic level (\emph{deep grounding}).  For these authors,
the convergence in dialogue, and even the repair of some misunderstandings, is
explained by this mimetic behavior more than by a monitoring of each other's
knowledge: \emph{``...interlocutors do not need to monitor and develop full
common ground as a regular, constant part of routine conversation, as it
would be unnecessary and far too costly. Establishment of full common ground
is, we argue, a specialized and non-automatic process that is used primarily
in times of difficulty (when radical misalignment becomes
apparent).''}~\cite{pickering2006alignment} This view is actually not
incompatible with Clark's \emph{grounding
criterion}~\cite{clark1989contributing}: the degree of shared understanding that
peers need to reach depends upon the task they perform. For instance, a dialogue
between two surgeons might rely on superficial alignment if they talk about
their friends but has to guarantee accurate common grounds when talking about
which intervention will be conducted in which way on which patient.

Deep grounding or shared meaning making requires some cognitive load. For Clark,
what is important is not the individual effort made by the receiver of a
communicative act, but the overall \emph{least collaborative
effort}~\cite{clark1986referring}.  The cost of producing a perfect utterance
may be higher than the cost of repairing the problems that may arise through
misunderstandings. For instance, subjects are less careful about adapting their
utterances to their partner when they know they can provide feedback on his/her
understanding~\cite{schober1993spatial}. Dillenbourg et al. introduced the
notion of \emph{optimal collaborative effort}~\cite{dillenbourg1995evolution} to
stress that misunderstanding should not be viewed as something to be avoided (if
this was possible), but as an opportunity to engage into verbalization,
explanation, negotiation, and so forth.



\paragraph{Developmental pathopsychology}

The false belief experiment that we have mentioned above, was proposed by
Baron-Cohen in the frame of his research on autistic spectrum disorders (he
shows that autistic children seem to actually lack a theory of mind and suggests
this as the primary cause of their social impairments), and Frith and HappÃ©
further note in ~\cite{frith1994autism} that this specific deficit of autism has
led to a large amount of research which proved, in turn, highly beneficial to
the study of the development of theory of mind in general. They reference
in~\cite{frith1994autism} eight such tasks (Table~\ref{mentalizing-tasks}),
identified during the study of social cognition by autistic children. Each of
them is proposed in two versions: one does not require mentalizing, while the
other does require it.  One of these tasks, for example, required children to
distinguish emotions, namely happy/sad faces on one hand (\emph{situation-based}
emotion), and surprised faces on the other (\emph{belief-based}
emotion)~\cite{baron1993children}.  Another task, based on the
\emph{penny-hiding game}, contrasts the two conditions in terms of \emph{object
occlusion} vs.~\emph{information occlusion}~\cite{baron1992out} (we detail it
hereafter). These tasks prototypically illustrate social meta-cognition: one
need to represent and reflect on someone else representations (and not only
perceptions), and they are not addressed by today's research on social robots.

Experimental protocols in research on autistic spectrum disorders are often
striking by their apparent straightforwardness because of the careful choice of
interaction modalities: since autistic children frequently exhibit impairments
beyond social ones (such as motor or linguistic ones), the experiments must be
designed such that they require only basic cognitive skills beyond the social
abilities that are tested. The Sally and Anne task, for instance, requires the
observing child to be able to visually follow the marble, to remember the true
location of the marble, to understand simple questions (``Where will Sally look
for her marble?'' in Baron-Cohen's protocol~\cite{baron1985does}) and eventually
to give an answer, either verbally or with a gesture -- the two first points
being actually explicitly checked through questions: ``Where is the marble
really?'' (reality control question) and ``Where was the marble in the
beginning?'' (memory control question).

Likewise, current social robots have limited cognitive skills (no fast yet fine
motor skills, limited speech production and understanding, limited scene
segmentation and object recognition capabilities, etc.) and such tasks
that effectively test a single cognitive skill (in this case, mentalizing) in
near isolation are of high relevance for experimental social robotics.

    \begin{tabular}{p{0.4\linewidth}p{0.5\linewidth}}

    \caption{\small Tasks requiring or not mentalizing to pass, listed by Frith and HappÃ© in~\cite{frith1994autism}}
    \label{mentalizing-tasks}
\end{table}

Frith and HappÃ©'s list (Table~\ref{mentalizing-tasks}) is in that regard
especially interesting in that it mirrors pairs of task (ones which do not
require mentalizing with similar ones which do require mentalizing), thus
providing control tasks.  \emph{Object occlusion} vs.~\emph{Information
occlusion} is one example of a (pair of) task(s) which evidence
representation-level perspective taking through \emph{adaptive deception}:
during a simple game, the experimenter adapts its strategy
(deceptive/non-deceptive behaviour) to the representation skills of its child
opponent. The experimental setting is derived from the penny-hiding game
protocol originally proposed by Oswald and Ollendick~\cite{oswald1989role} and
replicated and extended by Baron-Cohen in~\cite{baron1992out}, who describes it
as a two-person game in which the subject is actively involved, either as a
guesser or as a hider. The hider hides the penny in one hand or the other, and
then invites a guess. The game is repeated several time before switching the
roles. Baron-Cohen proposes a specific index to rate the level of the players
based on the idea of \emph{information occlusion}: minimally, the hider must
ensure \emph{object occlusion} (the penny must not become visible to the
guesser), while good hiders, with representation-level perspective taking
skills, develop strategies (like random hand switching or deictic hints at the
wrong hand) to prevent the guesser to find the penny (\emph{information
occlusion}). One could imagine a similar protocol adapted to robotics: the robot
would play the role of the experimenter, adapting on-line its
behaviour to what it understands of the perspective taking capabilities of the
children, and would consequently require \emph{second-order},
\emph{representation-level} perspective taking from the robot.

\section{Impact}\label{impact}

\subsection{Impact on society and technology: building an inclusive society}


\project will deliver new and fundamental knowledge to the fields of robotics,
computer science and psychology, in addition to improving trans-disciplinary
understanding between these disciplines. More specifically, the project will
contribute to a better understanding of the following research areas:
human-robot interaction; human-machine interaction; human error making and
handling in assembly tasks; theory of mind and its transfer to cognitive robots;
natural language processing; explainability and language generation; machine
vision and human activity detection; and action planning under uncertainty. New
interaction paradigms will be developed for handling error situations where
machines interact with non-expert humans. The integration of perception and
sensing into cognitive robot architectures will be critically reviewed and
extended. Novel, empirically informed methods to transfer findings from
human-human interaction studies to human-machine interactions will be developed.
Furthermore, the national and international psychology, robotics and computer
science research communities will benefit from the project results. We will
publish \project results in interdisciplinary and discipline-specific journals
and conferences, and organise \project-themed workshops. Please refer to Section
\ref{sec:impact} about our concrete action plan to maximise impact. 




Academically, the \project project represents a timely combination of
very recent advances in supervised machine learning for social robot
behaviour with a creative and interdisciplinary approach to the design
and automation of social robot behaviour. We therefore expect to publish
results in high-class scientific journals and conferences.

The dataset of social behaviours and social signals we will create and
distribute represents a one-in-a-kind resource for the human robot
interaction community, and the human data collection will be
transferable to research in other domains such as human-computer
interaction.

As \project will be deployed in a living lab environment, there is
significant scope for public outreach/engagement and media coverage,
which we will work with the BRL's media manager to maximise.

\subsection{T2.2}

The current state-of-the-art is limited in this respect: sub-symbolic
approaches focus on identifying low-level social signals (for instance,
gazing, gesture recognition) while symbolic approaches have focused on
classical symbolic problems like language understanding. Some attempts
have been made to bridge both (for instance, multi-modal dialogue
\cite{lemaignan2011grounding, lemaignan2017artificial}), but no work to
date has been able to interpret the social dynamics themselves (for
instance, \emph{are the partners getting along well?}, \emph{Is there
any frustration?}, \emph{Are they collaborating or not?}, \emph{Are they
engaged in their joint task?}). This is likely due to the complexity of
the problem, mixing sub-symbolic and symbolic reasoning in intricate
ways. Understanding social dynamics in naturalistic conditions entails
identifying a complex net of overlapping social cues, at multiple time
scales. Reasoning about these ever-changing, sometimes contradictory,
dynamics, is an essential skill for an artificial socio-cognitive
system, yet an essentially open research question.

I have recently introduced a dataset of social
interaction~\cite{lemaignan2018pinsoro} that enables for the first time a
quantitative, data-driven investigation of social dynamics. Promising initial
results led me to uncover three latent constructs that underpin social
interactions~\cite{bartlett2019what}. This dataset and the related on-going
scientific investigations will form the starting point of my approach to this
challenge.

\textbf{Data-driven continuous behaviour generation}


At a time where companion robots are coming to the market, one important
question remains fully open: how to design robot behaviours that foster
lasting engagement? A vast body of academic literature identifies that
robots evoke an initial phase of high user engagement (the
\emph{novelty} phase) that vanishes as the user realises that the robot
is actually quite predictable and repetitive. The \emph{agency}
initially ascribed by the user to the robot quickly fades (Lemaignan et
al. 2014), leading to critical user disengagement from the technology.

%\begin{wrapfigure}[23]{l}{6.5cm}
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\paperwidth]{figs/husky.jpg}
    \caption{\label{fig:robot}
    Provisional appearance of the \project robot that we ill use to collect
    data. A tablet, displaying facial animations, is mounted on a robotic arm.
    It can freely orient its `gaze' and use expressive movements. The mobile
    base (a Segway Husky) can autonomously navigate in the various parts of the
    BRL open-space}
\end{figure}
%\end{wrapfigure}

The (often limited) library of behaviours available to the robot is
often cited as a key factor in causing this issue. However, another,
more profound issue affecting long term engagement with robot companions
is the question of \emph{purpose.} Without clear \emph{purpose}, social
robot companions can lack \emph{usefulness}. Indeed, robot
\emph{companions} might not have explicit goals that would dictate or
motivate their behaviours: they aim at providing a social presence, a
social comfort, as cats or dogs would do, without necessarily being
goal-oriented.

Recent attempts -- and failures -- to convert social robotics research
into commercial platforms (Jibo, Kuri and most recently Anki's Cozmo and
Vector robots) reflect exactly this, with reasons for their failure
typically citing an under-delivery of the user experience they promised,
and/or the lack of a `real need' to justify their price point. The
\project project addresses these two key issues by:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Taking inspiration from human-pet relationships which also have no
  explicit \emph{purpose} beyond their potential for enjoyable,
  \emph{affective} interactions;
\item
  Working with creative professionals who excel at storytelling and
  emotional engagement to overcome the problems in sustaining
  engagement, as proposed by Hoffman\footnote{\url{https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/home-robots/anki-jibo-and-kuri-what-we-can-learn-from-social-robotics-failures}};
\item
  Blending these two sources of inspiration using a radically novel
  combination of immersive teleoperation and machine learning.
\end{enumerate}

The project is \emph{not} about replicating a pet's behaviour per se. It
is instead about identifying, modeling and automatically generating the
social behaviours required to recreate pet-like social dynamics between
robots and humans, drawing inspiration from ethology (Stanton, Sullivan,
and Fazio 2015). Using animal behaviours to inform the design of robots
is not new, the most remarkable example being the Sony AIBO robot dog,
whose behaviours were directly designed around those of actual dogs
(Arkin et al. 2003). However, to go beyond the repetitive interactions
associated with such robots, we propose to employ a creative
professional to actively participate in design and automation of \project
behaviour. The concept of using creative professionals to `teach' social
robot behaviour is not new either (Knight and Gray 2012), however it is
only recent advances in human-in-the-loop, online machine learning that
make this type of real-time `social training' a feasible approach to
generating and automating engaging social behaviours (Senft et al.
2019).

Our project has the following goals, addressed by the workplan presented
below:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  assemble a non-anthropomorphic social robot that can autonomously
  navigate in a complex and living lab environment, taking inspiration
  from ethology to inspire the robot's behaviour;
\item
  develop an immersive teleoperation system, enabling a creative
  professional to `take control' of the robot (i.e.~puppet the robot) in
  a completely intuitive way (using whole body motion tracking);
\item
  record (and make publicly available) a large dataset of social
  behaviours (created through immersive teleoperation) that foster
  long-term social and affective engagement. The dataset will also
  include the social \emph{signals} implicitly used by the puppeteer to
  drive his/her choice of actions (recorded through eg eye-tracking);
\item
  using machine learning, map these social signals (input state) to the
  robot behaviours (output state) such that the robot can operate
  autonomously.
\end{enumerate}

A creative professional (puppeteer, dancer or comedian --
corresponding financial compensation is budgeted) will join the group.
First she/he will take part to a one-week co-design workshop (4) aiming
at finalising the immersive teleoperation controller and the behaviours
of the robot. Then, she/he will interact for about 4 hours a day during
a month, with the BRL lab members (200+ researchers). She/he will do so
by remotely operating the robot (5) from an (out-of-sight) control room
(the BRL CAVE room). The aim will be for the puppeteer to pro-actively
engage with people in the lab, attempting to engage in \emph{social,
affective} interactions. This will be achieved by creating/inventing
in-situ a new `grammar' of social behaviour, loosely inspired by those
of cats and other pets. These interactions will be fully recorded
(including eye-tracking on the puppeeter) (6), in order to create a
unique dataset of complex social interactions, suitable for machine
learning. The PI has already extensive experience in recording such
datasets (see (Lemaignan et al. 2018) for instance).

%\begin{wrapfigure}[17]{l}{8cm}
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\paperwidth]{figs/dev.pdf}
    \caption{\label{fig:support}
    Social behaviours will be learned from immersive `puppetering' of the
    robot, performed by a professional actor. The `puppetering' takes place
    in a CAVE (or VR) environment, where what the robot `sees' and `hears'
    is streamed live}
\end{figure}
%\end{wrapfigure}

Over the following four months, a deep neural network will be designed
and trained (7) for the regression task of generating continuous social
behaviours from perceived social signals. In parallel, a software
controller will be developed (8) to enable generic autonomous
capabilities (like autonomous navigation) for which the BRL has
extensive expertise.

Finally, the last four months will be dedicated to in-situ testing of
the autonomous system (9). We will seek to conduct a large scale study
within the lab, over a period of several weeks. For this study, the
robot is expected to be fully autonomous. However sufficient amount of
time is planned for additional iterations on the development of the
robot controller if deemed necessary. We aim at publishing the results
of this main study shortly after the end of the one-year period.

\subsection{Evidence-based research: demonstrable usefulness of social robots in
real-world, complex scenarios}


Critically, the scientific investigation of these questions (\emph{conceptual
framing of robot-supported human-human interaction}, \emph{socially-driven
cognitive architecture},  \emph{online social situation assessment and social
behaviour generation}) has to be
grounded in real-world applications. Indeed, two complex, high impact
applications are detailed in the project. The first one takes place in
Bristol's Children Hospital: a social robot will be permanently deployed in one
of ward, supporting isolated children who suffer long-term conditions, in close
cooperation with the hospital staff. The second one involves the deployment of 
social robots in special need schools (SEN schools) in Bristol. Building on a
rigorous participatory approach involving the school teachers, as well as the
parents, we will seek to integrate the robot in the daily life of the school,
supporting the development of the students' physical and social skills.

These two applications, detailed hereafter, aim at supporting
socially-vulnerable populations: this entails specific risks (detailed and
addressed in the Section~\ref{risks}), but also offers a unique opportunity to
demonstrate in a real-world, impactful case, how social robots can effectively
have a positive, ethical impact, and support in-fine stronger, richer
human-human interactions.


\project aims at developing and demonstrating the need for a global approach to
social HRI with ambitious, high-impact, socially meaningful, applications.

The two last application scenarios are ambitious and inherently risky, as they
target vulnerable populations. This is an however informed choice: first, we
already have established partnerships with Bristol's children hospital on one
hand, and a network of Bristol-based SEN schools on the other hand. As such, and
from a practical perspective, we do not foresee any institutional issues -- on
the contrary, our partners are excited at the prospect of taking part to the
project. Besides, convincingly demonstrating the importance and positive impact
of socially-driven, socially-responsible robotics does accordingly require
complex social situations, and complex social dynamics. The two scenarios, which
complement each other, provide both. These scenarios also put the project in the
unique position of actually delivering high societal impact: we anticipate 100+
hospitalised children with long-term conditions, and 50+ SEN-educated children
to directly benefit of the project, showing how robots can have a lasting,
strong, positive impact on the society, also establishing the idea of
\emph{robots supporting human interactions} instead of dehumanising our social
relationships.


\TODO{probably useful to give specific examples of interventions}

\subsection{Application 1: WeTheCurious City lab}

\subsection{Application 2: Social robots in SEN schools}

Can a socially assistive robot effectively support the development (learning?),
social interactions and well-being of children with a long-term mental
condition? Our project aim is an investigation of this question: how can a
social robot integrate into the eco-system of a SEN (Special Educational Needs)
school (specifically, the Mendip School, which welcomes pupils with ASD
(Autistic Spectrum Disorder), and effectively support the day-to-day work of the
school staff to support the development, learning and well-being of the
children. This project is naturally interdisciplinary as it requires expertise
from mental health/special needs education, classroom design and social
robotics. 

The main questions we seek to investigate are: What are the (social \& spatial)
underpinnings of the successful integration of a social robot in the school
ecosystem? Can ambitious co-design with the end-users (teachers) deliver a 'net
gain' for the learning, social interaction and well-being of the students? 


The core of the project consists of deploying a social robot (likely one of the
BRL-owned Softbank Peppers) in a Bristol-based SEN school (the Mendip School),
to investigate how the robot can help shaping a spatial and social school
ecology that fosters mental well-being, while effectively supporting teachers
and students in their learning. 

The project will adopt a strong participatory design approach, with 2 one-day
workshops organised with the school teachers; and one evening workshop with the
school parents, prior to the school study (Jun./Jul. 2020). During the first
workshop, the teachers will be introduced to the robot capabilities with
examples of robot-supported teaching activities, and the robot's visual
programming interface will be introduced. We will also conduct group discussions
on how the robot can best be integrated in the daily school routine and
classroom context. During the second workshop, the teachers will be invited to
create novel activities, with the support of the research team. An evening focus
group will be organised as well with the parents, to integrate their
perspectives in the design of the robotic system.  Will we formally analyse the
data from this â will it become a research paper? 

Following the workshops, the teacher-oriented codesign of the robot's activities
and supervision tools (eg to start/stop/pause/resume activities) will be
finalised and implemented by the research team (Aug./Sep.2020). 

The school study itself will take place over 2 months (tentatively Oct./Nov.
2020), with the robot visiting the school once a week for the whole day. During
these visits, the robot will take part in the regular teaching and other daily
routines of the school, and will directly interact with the children. While the
robot's behaviours will have been co-designed with the teachers, the robot will
be teleoperated by a member of the research team, to ensure we do not create an
additional burden for the staff. 

During the 'robot days', observations will be conducted by the research team,
and regular semi-structured interviews will be conducted with the teachers,
parents, and where possible, the children themselves, to understand how the
robot impacts the school dynamics  (both positively and potentially negatively).
Is it appropriate/pertinent to do pre- and post- surveys of acceptance of robot? 



\subsection{Application 3: A robot companion at the children's hospital}


\TODO{explain that these 2 large experiments will be scaffolded by many smaller
ones}

\subsection{Experimental deployments: risks and mitigations}

These two application scenarios are ambitious and inherently risky, as they
target vulnerable populations. However, first, demonstrating the
importance of advanced social modelling, and convincingly proving the
effectiveness of our approach does require accordingly complex social
situations, and complex social dynamics. The two scenarios, which complement
each other, provide both.

Second, working with vulnerable populations, in constrained and complex
environments (children hospital and SEN schools) adds significant risks to the
project. But it is also what make the project in the unique position of
delivering a high societal impact: a direct positive impact on children's
lives (we anticipate 100+ hospitalised children and 50+ refugee children
interacting over long periods of time with a robot over the course of the
project), and a broader impact on the society, showing how robots can have a
lasting, strong, positive impact on the society, also establishing the idea of
\emph{robots supporting human interactions} instead of dehumanising our social
relationships.

The two main mitigations are (1) early and continuous engagement with the
stakeholders, and (2) the decoupling of the two applications, meaning that the
risks associated to each of them do not impact the other one.

Early engagement will be ensured by relying on a participatory design
methodology, involving all the stakeholders from the onset of the project; the
methodology will involve regular joint workshops; on-site (hospital and refugee
camps) research stay including engagement with the staff/charities and the
children themselves; use of art-based participatory techniques like puppetering.
I will also perform field testing early on in the project, relying if necessary
on provisional robot platforms available at the host institution (for instance,
Softbank Nao and Pepper). This user-centered approach will be championed by one
of the post-doc recruited on the project, who will have recognised expertise in
user-centered design.


The Principal Investigator, Dr.  SÃ©verin Lemaignan, has been working for 12+
years in human-robot interaction, and over the last 6 years, specifically in the
field of child-robot interaction.  His profile is both highly technical, with
hundreds of hardware and software contributions to the worldwide robotic
community; and highly experimental, running dozens of studies and experiments
with children, including long-term ones, in muliple schools and in healthcare
environments. He is in a unique position to deliver both a scientific
breakthrough on social situation assessment for robots, and a high-impact
societal change.

\section{Interdisciplinarity}


\section{Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI)}



One example: a common (ethics-related) objection to human-robot interaction is
the perceived deceptive nature of the robot's role. As recently
argued~\cite{biscontilucidi2018companion}, the underlying concern is likely
instead the need to simulate of a human-like interaction with robots, in the
absence of an adequate (and novel) model of human-robot interactions to refer
to.


BS 8611~\cite{bsi2016robots}
~\cite{stahl2018implementing}


\TODO{taken from Stahl2018; rephrase}

The EC has adopted RRI as a cross-cut-
ting activity in its Horizon 2020 research framework programme.

For the purposes of this paper, I will use the concept of RRI as put developed
by~\cite{stilgoe2013developing} and subsequently adopted by the UK Engineering
and Physical Sciences Research Council~\cite{owen2014uk}. This concept
represents RRI using the acronym AREA, which stands for anticipation,
reflection, engagement and action. A piece of research or innovation activity,
in order to count as having been undertaken responsibly, would need to
incorporate anticipation about possible consequences, integrate mechanisms of
reflection about the work, its aims and purposes, engage with relevant
stakeholders and guid action of researchers accordingly.

\subsection{c. Resources}\label{c.-resources}}


The \project project sets an ambitious target in term of technical development.
The project indeed requires unique technical skills, both software and
hardware-wise, to create, design and build the envisioned robotic systems.

Software-wise, PI Lemaignan is a leading
developer of software for intelligent robots, with numerous contributions to
the major software platforms used in robotic (including major contributions to
ROS, OpenCV, authoring of widely-used pieces of software like the ROS-naoqi
bridge used by hundred of researchers using the Nao and Pepper robots or the
MORSE robotic simulator). He has been teaching various modules related to
software development for robotics, and the breadth and depth of his knowledge of
robotic software development is well established. He will be leading the
software development, and, as part of the fellowship, he will also seek for
additional expert knowledge on (1) interaction design and (2) low-level
micro-programming to complete the set of required programming needs.

Hardware-wise, the Bristol Robotics Lab, where this fellowship will take place,
offer unique support and facilities for robotic hardware development: the
laboratory's dedicated equipment includes two industrial-grade rapid prototyping
machine, a laser cutter, one 5-axis digital milling machine, all the required
facilities for PCB prototyping, and a team of six full-time technicians,
specialised in hardware development. The BRL has indeed a long track-record of
designing and building new and original robots (from the BERT humanoid in the
FP7 CHRIS project, to micro-robotics [in...?], to [...]). \project will directly
benefit of this expertise, which will ensure a feasible and realistic technical
implementation of the \project robots. Besides, an hardware engineer, dedicated
to the project, will be recruited in the frame of the project.

The BRL also include a hardware incubator and is co-located with 70 start-ups
and SMEs specialising in robotic hardware and mechatronics (Bristol's
\emph{FutureSpace}). This combination of excellent research and vast industry
expertise on one site is unique in the UK, and is will play an instrumental role
in providing a coherent and strong pathway to impact to the project, including
further engagement with industrial partners and spin-off opportunities.


\hypertarget{host-institution}{%
\subsubsection{Host institution}\label{host-institution}}

The \emph{Bristol Robotics Laboratory (BRL)} is the largest co-located
and most comprehensive advanced robotics research establishment in the
UK. It is a joint venture between the University of the West of England
and the University of Bristol. BRL's multidisciplinary approach aims to
create autonomous devices capable of working independently, with each
other, or with humans. BRL draws on robotics, electrical \& mechanical
engineering, computer science, psychology, cognitive science and
sociology. BRL has an international reputation as a leading research
centre in advanced robotics research and has over 250 researchers
working on a broad portfolio of topics: HRI, collective robotics, aerial
robotics, neuro-inspired control, haptics, control systems, energy
harvesting and self-sustaining systems, rehabilitation robotics, soft
robotics and biomedical systems. BRL has many collaboration
partnerships, both national and international, and is experienced in
managing large multi-site projects. BRL has support from two embedded
units specialising in business and enterprise, together with an
incubator and successful track record of spin-outs.
