\section*{Abstract}\label{abstract}

\eu{The abstract (summary) should, at a glance, provide the reader with a clear
understanding of the objectives of the research proposal and how they will be
achieved. The abstract will be used as the short description of your research
proposal in the evaluation process and in communications to contact in
particular the potential remote referees and/or inform the Commission and/or the
programme management committees and/or relevant national funding agencies
(provided you give permission to do so where requested in the online proposal
submission forms, section 1). It must therefore be short and precise and should
not contain confidential information. \\
Please use plain typed text, avoiding formulae and other special characters. The
abstract must be written in English. There is a limit of 2000 characters (spaces
and line breaks included).}

\TODO{Tiny bit too long! 2085 char instead of 2000}

Physical AI systems which interact with humans -- like social robots -- are
currently ``hitting a wall'': while current perception and modelling tools have
made good progress in representing the \emph{physical} properties of humans (detecting
faces, voices, etc), very little progress has been made on representing them as
\emph{social agents}, embedded in a dynamic, sometimes complex, social situation.

The \project project aims at achieving a major breakthrough on how these systems
model, represent and reason about their social environment. Inspired by how
large language models are able to encode complex social semantics, \project
investigates how these models can be leveraged to introduce \emph{social
embeddings}: compact, highly expressive mathematical representations of
arbitrary social situations.  Building on the early concept that I already
validated and published, \project will fully characterise social embeddings;
expand their scope to complex, real-world social situations; and demonstrate
their transformative potential through deployment of socially
intelligent robots in several experimental settings.

\project is built around three axes: a basic research programme; an experimental
programme that looks specifically at the application of social embeddings to
social robotics; and, running in parallel to those first two axes, a scientific
investigation of the ethical dimension of social embeddings. This last axe,
highly interdisciplinary in nature, is expected to contribute to the emerging
roadmap for Responsible Robotics, with a focus on behavioural transparency,
understandability, and human agency.
%
%represents the first part of \project. The second
%part focuses on the several breakthroughs in social robotics enabled by this
%novel representation. Specifically, the project looks into context-aware
%behaviour generation for social robots, and user-led interactive machine
%learning for lifelong behaviour adaption.
%
%The third and final part of the project investigates the ethical aspects of
%context-aware social robots. Adopting an interdisciplinary approach, \project
%will contribute to the emerging roadmaps for Responsible Robotics from the
%perspective of behavioural transparency, understandability, and human agency.
%
%Integral to these three parts, the research programme of \project is supported
%by an ambitious experimental programme, that will include long-term (up to 6
%months) deployments of a social robot in complex human eco-systems, including eg
%elderly care centres.

With the long-term vision of service robots that are socially useful and well
accepted, \project creates for the first time a realistic and practical path to
\emph{social awareness}, interactive and physical AI systems: a new, complex
socio-cognitive skill that makes it possible to explicitely model and reason
about one's social environment. We anticipate this discovery to open multiple
new and exciting research venues and applications in robotics and AI, and
beyond, in social sciences.
