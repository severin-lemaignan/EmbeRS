\section*{Abstract}\label{abstract}

\eu{The abstract (summary) should, at a glance, provide the reader with a clear
understanding of the objectives of the research proposal and how they will be
achieved. The abstract will be used as the short description of your research
proposal in the evaluation process and in communications to contact in
particular the potential remote referees and/or inform the Commission and/or the
programme management committees and/or relevant national funding agencies
(provided you give permission to do so where requested in the online proposal
submission forms, section 1). It must therefore be short and precise and should
not contain confidential information. \\
Please use plain typed text, avoiding formulae and other special characters. The
abstract must be written in English. There is a limit of 2000 characters (spaces
and line breaks included).}

AI is already part of our daily life, and robots are increasingly part of our
everyday lives, supporting our ageing society, and assisting teachers in
classrooms. In this context, how to ensure `by-design' that these social robots
have a positive social impact? This question is the backbone of the \project
research project, and our specific objective is that, within 5 years, we create
a socially-intelligent and responsible robot, that (1) will have recognised
social utility, and (2) will see long-term acceptance by its users.

We formulate two main hypotheses: (1) this objective can only be achieved if the
robot is socially-driven: the robot's behaviours must be driven by the intention
to support positive human-human interactions. How this general principle
translates into specific guidelines and algorithms -- while taking into account
the principles of a responsible AI -- is a central contribution of the \project
project.

(2) Long-term acceptance requires genuine involvement of the end-users at every
step of the design process. To this end, \project introduces a novel methodology
involving `public-in-the-loop' machine learning: the large scale participation
of end-users, over extended periods of time, to teach the robot how to become a
good and responsible social helper.

\project tests these two hypotheses with an ambitious work programme. It includes
basic research and conceptual framing; extensive, beyond-state-of-art, technical
developments; and an ambitious experimental programme, with a combined three
years of field deployment of social robots in public spaces.

\project opens a unique window into the positive role social robots can play in our
future societies; it will provide a lasting legacy, paving the way forward for a
better understanding of the design of socially-intelligent robots that are
socially useful and acceptable in the long-term.
