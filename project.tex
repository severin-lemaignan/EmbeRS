\section*{Abstract}\label{abstract}

\eu{The abstract (summary) should, at a glance, provide the reader with a clear
understanding of the objectives of the research proposal and how they will be
achieved. The abstract will be used as the short description of your research
proposal in the evaluation process and in communications to contact in
particular the potential remote referees and/or inform the Commission and/or the
programme management committees and/or relevant national funding agencies
(provided you give permission to do so where requested in the online proposal
submission forms, section 1). It must therefore be short and precise and should
not contain confidential information. \\
Please use plain typed text, avoiding formulae and other special characters. The
abstract must be written in English. There is a limit of 2000 characters (spaces
and line breaks included).}


The \project project aims at achieving a major breakthrough on how artificial
systems (primarily, social robots) model, represent and reason about their
social environment. Inspired by how large language models are able to encode
complex social semantics and dynamics, \project investigates how
these models can be leveraged to introduce \emph{social embeddings}: compact,
highly expressive mathematical representations of arbitrary social situations.
While the core validity of the basic idea has already been demonstrated,
\project will fully characterise social embeddings, and expand their scope to
complex, real-world social situations.

This basic research programme represents the first part of \project. The second
part focuses on the several breakthroughs in social robotics enabled by this
novel representation. Specifically, the project looks into context-aware
behaviour generation for social robots, and user-led interactive machine
learning for lifelong behaviour adaption.

The third and final part of the project investigates the ethical aspects of
context-aware social robots. Adopting an interdisciplinary approach, \project
will contribute to the emerging roadmaps for Responsible Robotics from the
perspective of behavioural transparency, understandability, and human agency.

Integral to these three parts, the research programme of \project is supported
by an ambitious experimental programme, that will include long-term (up to 6
months) deployments of a social robot in complex human eco-systems, including eg
elderly care centres.

With the long-term vision of service robots that are socially useful and well
accepted, \project will enable robots to explicitely model and reason about
their social environment, a new critical socio-cognitive capability that will
open multiple new research venues and applications in robotics and AI, but also
possibly beyond, in social sciences for instance.
