\paragraph ACAMH conference on Mental health and refugees:

Keywords:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Trauma
    \item Unaccompanied Asylum Seeking Children
\end{itemize}

Discussion with Helen Peden, Refugee Council, happy to contact
\begin{itemize}
    \item litteracy issues; example -> learn to read a map
    \item need to be primarily verbal
    \item work with 16/20 yo

\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item 25M refugees, 50\% under 18
\end{itemize}

Good talk b Sarah Hunt (Uni Leicester)

\begin{itemize}
    \item Participatory Action Research ("From voice to agency", Rodriguez and
        Brown 2009)
    \item focus on post-migratory risk factors to mental health
    \item hceck photo of litterature review
    \item check participatory methodology (photos of slides)
    \item 3 themes emerging from her research: understanding trauma; need for
        responsive/individualised pathways; need for housing + basic needs
        provisions
    \item she mention lack of privacy in some provided housing as a permanent
        threat and a source of stress/trauma: \textbf{relation to privacy by
        design}
    \item point out the need to support not only the children but also the
        schools
    \item reference to World Awarness Children in Trauma Model (WACIT, Vostanis
        2012-2018)
    \item example of social integration issues: lack of knowledge of school
        rules (like raising ones' hands, perceived as bad behaviours/threatening
        behaviour); difficulty to meet with peers
    \item point raised about need for refugee children to 'fit in a new
        identity, matching local norms/expectation, at the cost of the previous,
        original identity -> source of suffering: importance of \emph{securing
        identity}, as done by some schools (example of school inviting parents
        of diverse background to come and cook home dishes at school, with
        different background every week)
\end{itemize}


Prof Ravi Kohli (child welfare):

\begin{itemize}
    \item Safety <-> belonging <-> success (cf photo)
    \item ...but not a straight line! Comes and go!
    \item underline the need by refugees to reciprocate
    \item make a strong point on individual identities instead of being just a label (cf
        photo)
    \item \textbf{importance of individual stories}
\end{itemize}

Powerful presentation by Bobby Lloyds; she stayed 2 days/week for 4 years in
Calais camp; visual artist + art therapist; large archive of field experience on
Facebook account (ArtRefuge UK)

She points out the importance of mobile phones -> communication, story telling,
etc

Talk Lucy Arnsby-Wilson:

\begin{itemize}
    \item "how can we help people to feel fully alive?"
    \item a couple of examples of cultural differences (cf photo 'Rights and
        autonomy')
    \item mental safety at the end of the interaction: "will you remember me?"
\end{itemize}

Talk Katheryn Cronin (lawyer, really interesting, might be worth contacting her
for feedback if we go the 'robot collecting stories' route)

\begin{itemize}
    \item "process if requesting refugee status is highly destructive"
    \item importance of the narration, story when facing home office/judge
    \item \textbf{robot to collect \emph{individual} stories and print them out as
        testimonies}: could be useful to help children to build up their case
    \item often the story ("dad abducted by talibans, mum fearing for child,
        send child away") is heard again and again by judges, they automatically
        dismiss it as being a lie based on a 'template' provided by smugglers
    \item the children often lack the skillset required to tell their stories as
        they come from small villages where everyone know everyone (-> no need
        to ever tell own story)
    \item children also struggle to communicate/explain misunderstandings to
        judge due to different realities: eg: no street light in Afghanistan
        village, so child could hide from taliban raid. Hard to believe for UK
        judge, but the child does not understand why it is hard to believe as he
        does not know that every single street/house would have lights in the UK
    \item she mention the type of room (light, airy, placement of chairs, etc)
        to avoid reproducing the sense of oppression experienced by the children
        during their journey (eg locked in the back of a lorry)
    \item refugee convention is about assessing vulnerability of children if
        they were to return -> most of the interviews while requesting asylum is
        about assessing/measuring weaknesses/vulnerabilities instead of their
        strength/resilience while they travelled the world. Harsh. need to
        'train' the children to talk about their vulnerabilities.
    \item 'is their story tainted by smugglers'? question of how genuine the
        story is. Use of robot to disclose their stories?
    \item example of Afgani children often told to claim their parents are dead
        or disappeared as they are told it could help them getting refugee
        status. Counter productive (because create inconsistencies in their
        stories) + traumatic
    \item importance of the sense of security <-> trust -> robot needs to by
        trustworthy \textbf{high level of privacy, control; privacy by design}
    \item under EU law, children must receive support to reconnect with their
        families, but almost nothing is done. Could robots help by sharing
        stories online? (potential privacy landfield, though)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Title of the proposal}\label{title-of-the-proposal}

\textbf{Social robots to support human-human interactions}

\subsection*{Acronym}\label{acronym}

WizMe

\subsection*{Abstract}\label{abstract}

WizMe is a future-looking project that aims at investigating how social
robots can shape and support stronger \emph{human-human} relationships:
in a time where robots are on the verge of becoming pervasive in our
environment, can we use them as powerful tool to develop rich, positive human
interactions as well?


Such robots require unique, beyond state-of-the-art, capabilities to
\emph{(1)} understand the social interactions (\emph{social situation
awareness}), \emph{(2)} decide the best course of action for short-term
and longer-term social influence, and \emph{(3)} perform the appropriate
social acts and exert adequate, ethical social influence.

In the WizMe project, we propose to scaffold this radically novel line
of research with an original application of high societal impact: we
will create a small set of novel personal companion robots designed to
facilitate human-human interactions. These robots will be deployed in
selected school to support the social and cultural integration of
vulnerable children, with a particular focus on migrant children who
might lack the otherwise needed support for a successful integration
(different cultures and social norms; absence of local, culturally
integrated, relatives; language barriers; etc.).

This project is ambitious, and brings together five leading groups in
social human-robot interaction, interaction design and human
socio-developmental psychology, with unique expertise and contributions:
The Bristol Robotics Lab, the largest UK robotic lab, has a long history
of running and leading complex projects involving hardware, software and
AI, with a strong track record in human-robot interaction and assistive
robotics; the University of Ghent will provide world-leading expertise
on robot design for interaction with children; the EPFL's CHILI lab has
a unique expertise in blending technology (and social robotics in
particular) in teaching environments, with a focus on rich social
interaction; the IST is recognised as a leading group in expressive
social agents and also has a very strong track record in child-robot
interactions; finally {[}socio-psychology partner{]}.

Critically, the complex interaction design that lies at the core of the
project will be informed and co-led by the Refugee Support department of
RedCross UK, one of the largest NGO world-wide.

\subsection{Long-term vision and targeted breakthrough towards that vision}

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figs/render5-colors.png}
\end{figure}

WizMe is a project that aims at helping to build strong human
relationships with the help of technology.

The core idea of the project is to build small companion robots whose
aim is to facilitate human-human interactions. We want to develop these
robots with a particular application in mind: supporting the social and
cultural integration of vulnerable children in a foreign country, and in
particular, migrant children who might lack the otherwise needed support
(shared culture; already well integrated relatives) for a successful
integration.

\subsubsection{Key scientific research questions}

\begin{enumerate}
\item research the role of social influence to scaffold positive human-human
    interactions (including its ethical ramifications) in the context of migrant
    integration;
\item explore how a small robot companion can be endowed with social
    competencies to positively influence human interactions; design and
    implement the corresponding artificial social behaviours;
\item design and build a small rugged and autonomous companion robot that
    realise this goal for child-child interactions; test the technology in
    school with actual migrant children.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Vision of a novel form of interaction ``human-(robot)-human''}

\paragraph{The case of the social integration of migrant children}

A robot is left with the child when he or she starts their journey in
their new host country, and becomes a companion for the child during the
first months of the integration. Using several mechanisms that are
discussed in this proposal, the robot helps the child to gain
self-confidence, and ultimately engage in successful social interactions
with other children.

Critically, the robot is designed to support the social and cultural
integration of the child \emph{amongst her/his peers}. While the child
might build affective/emotional bonds with the robot over the course of
the support period, the robot behaviour is designed to ensure that these
bonds do not substitute themselves to the interactions with other
children.

The project combines a range of scientific and engineering endeavours to
realise within a 5-years timeframe an ambitious and bold vision for
social robotics in our society. Specifically, the project draws from the
fields of social robotics; human-robot interaction; human-machine
interaction design; and mechatronics.

While the breadth of the proposed project is significant (from
mechatronic design to long-term field testing with vulnerable
populations), the project structure minimizes the cross-dependencies
within the project, avoiding critical failure points that would put the
whole project at risk, and a careful risk assessment is conducted that
includes meaningful mitigation strategies.

Plan to hire one mechatronics engineer and one interaction designer

Role of the mechatronics engineer: develop a novel platform, including -
chassis - power autonomy for one day - on-board compute suitable for
deep learning (NVidia TX2?) - vision (embedded RGB-D camera) - audio
processing

Role of the interaction designer: refine interaction modalities (in
particular, the non-verbal speech), details cross-modal interactions,
define interaction patterns with the child

Dr Séverin Lemaignan is Senior Researcher at the Bristol Robotics
Laboratory, University of the West of England, Bristol. Previously, he
obtained a joint PhD in Cognitive Robotics from the CNRS/LAAS (France)
and the Technical University of Munich (Germany) for which he received
the Best PhD in Robotics 2012 award from French CNRS. He then conducted
his research as Research Fellow at EPFL (Switzerland) and Plymouth
University (UK) where he was Lecturer in Robotics until 2018. Dr Séverin
Lemaignan has been involved in several European projects related to
social and cognitive robotics: CHRIS (Cooperative Human Robot
Interaction Systems), DREAM (Development of Robot-Enhanced therapy for
children with AutisM spectrum disorders), L2TOR (Second language
TutOring using social Robots). He has also been awarded in 2015 a EU
H2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Individual Fellowship for his project
DoRoThy (Donating Robots a Theory of Mind). His research interests
primarily concern the socio-cognitive aspects of human-robot
interaction, both from the perspective of the human cognition and the
design of cognitive architectures for the robots. More recently, he has
been focusing his experimental work on child-robot interactions in
educative settings, exploring how robots can support teachers and
therapists to develop effective and engaging novel learning paradigms.
