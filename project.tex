understanding of the objectives of the research proposal and how they will be

programme management committees and/or relevant national funding agencies
(provided you give permission to do so where requested in the online proposal
submission forms, section 1). It must therefore be short and precise and should

% ALTERNATIVE ABSTRACT (draft), focusing on social sciences
%Data-driven social sciences are hitting a ``representation wall'': while current
%perception and modelling tools have made good progress in representing humans
%as \emph{individuals}, little progress has been made on representing them as \emph{social
%agents}, embedded in dynamic and complex social situations. This ``wall`` is
%e Cyber-physical systems which interact with humans -- like social robots -- 

% ALTERNATE ABSTRACT 2:
%Physical AI systems which interact with humans -- like social robots -- are
%currently ``hitting a wall'': while current perception and modelling tools have
%made good progress in representing the \emph{physical} properties of humans (detecting
%faces, voices, etc), very little progress has been made on representing them as
%\emph{social agents}, embedded in a dynamic, sometimes complex, social situation.

Artificial agents embedded in a social space (like avatars in a virtual world,
or social robots interacting with humans) continuously need to represent and
reason about their social environment: `What is going on?' `Are those two people
in front of me talking to me, or talking \emph{about} me?' `What do these facial
expressions and gaze tell me about the intentions of these other people?' `Is
that laugh I hear the sign of genuine enjoyment or ackward incomfort?' etc. This
ill-defined social `space' certainly appears high-dimensional; until now,
however, no-one has been able to comprehensively model it, and reduce its dimensionality
to a tractable level that would enable artificial agents to compare, recognize,
predict, generate novel social situations: in one word, to become socially
intelligent agents.

The \project project aims at breaking new grounds in that regard, by introducing the first
practical computational model of social situations. I first observe that
state-of-art large language models do encode in their latent space the complex
social semantics implicitly described in their training sets. Then, I leverage
these same models to introduce the novel idea of \emph{social embeddings}:
compact, semantics-preserving mathematical representations of arbitrary social
situations. I fully characterise these social embeddings, expand their
scope to complex, real-world social situations, to finally demonstrate their
transformative potential for artificial social agents, both virtual avatars,
and socially autonomous robots, deployed in complex real-world social
environments.

%\project is built around three axes: first, a basic research programme on
%social embeddings; second, a cognitive science axe on artifical social
%awareness; and third, an experimental programme that looks specifically at the
%application of social embeddings to social robotics.

%
%represents the first part of \project. The second
%part focuses on the several breakthroughs in social robotics enabled by this
%novel representation. Specifically, the project looks into context-aware
%behaviour generation for social robots, and user-led interactive machine
%learning for lifelong behaviour adaption.
%
%The third and final part of the project investigates the ethical aspects of
%context-aware social robots. Adopting an interdisciplinary approach, \project
%will contribute to the emerging roadmaps for Responsible Robotics from the
%perspective of behavioural transparency, understandability, and human agency.
%
%Integral to these three parts, the research programme of \project is supported
%by an ambitious experimental programme, that will include long-term (up to 6
%months) deployments of a social robot in complex human eco-systems, including eg
%elderly care centres.

This computational model -- and in particular, the idea of social embeddings --
represents not only a major step forward for artificial social agents, but more
broadly, is a paradigm shift for the modelling of social environments: \project
has the potential to have a major impact not only in AI, but also beyond, in social
robotics and digital social sciences.

%With the long-term vision of intelligent artificial agents, accepted as socially
%competent partners, \project creates for the first time a realistic and
%practical path to \emph{artifical social situation awareness}: the complex
%socio-cognitive skill of explicitely modelling and reasonning
%about one's rich social environment.


\section*{Cross-panel nature of the project}\label{panels}

\project is an interdisciplinary project: it applies methods from artificial
intelligence to build a compact representation of the social environment of a
socially-situated agent. As such, while the project is most directly attached to
Artificial Intelligence (ERC panel PE6-7), the results of \project are
especially relevant to the panel SH3 (in particular, SH3-13: Digital Social
Research), as it introduces a radically new paradigm to efficiently model and
reason on the social space of an agent; and to panels related to Human-Agent
interaction (PE6-8 for video games, PE7-10 for robotics), as the outcomes
of \project will enable the implementation of the next generation of
socially-competent artificial agents.

Note that, while deep learning algorithms lay at the heart of the project,
\project leverages these algorithm, instead of directly contributing to them. As such,
this project is not directly relevant to sub-panel PE6-11 -- Machine learning.
