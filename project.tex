Good talk b Sarah Hunt (Uni Leicester)

\begin{itemize}
    \item Participatory Action Research ("From voice to agency", Rodriguez and
        Brown 2009)
    \item focus on post-migratory risk factors to mental health
    \item hceck photo of litterature review
    \item check participatory methodology (photos of slides)
    \item 3 themes emerging from her research: understanding trauma; need for
        responsive/individualised pathways; need for housing + basic needs
        provisions
    \item she mention lack of privacy in some provided housing as a permanent
        threat and a source of stress/trauma: \textbf{relation to privacy by
        design}
    \item point out the need to support not only the children but also the
        schools
    \item reference to World Awarness Children in Trauma Model (WACIT, Vostanis
        2012-2018)
    \item example of social integration issues: lack of knowledge of school
        rules (like raising ones' hands, perceived as bad behaviours/threatening
        behaviour); difficulty to meet with peers
    \item point raised about need for refugee children to 'fit in a new
        identity, matching local norms/expectation, at the cost of the previous,
        original identity -> source of suffering: importance of \emph{securing
        identity}, as done by some schools (example of school inviting parents
        of diverse background to come and cook home dishes at school, with
        different background every week)

Powerful presentation by Bobby Lloyds; she stayed 2 days/week for 4 years in
Calais camp; visual artist + art therapist; large archive of field experience on

\begin{itemize}
    \item "how can we help people to feel fully alive?"
    \item a couple of examples of cultural differences (cf photo 'Rights and
        autonomy')
    \item mental safety at the end of the interaction: "will you remember me?"
\end{itemize}

Talk Katheryn Cronin (lawyer, really interesting, might be worth contacting her
for feedback if we go the 'robot collecting stories' route)

\begin{itemize}
    \item "process if requesting refugee status is highly destructive"
    \item importance of the narration, story when facing home office/judge
    \item \textbf{robot to collect \emph{individual} stories and print them out as
        testimonies}: could be useful to help children to build up their case
    \item often the story ("dad abducted by talibans, mum fearing for child,
        send child away") is heard again and again by judges, they automatically
        dismiss it as being a lie based on a 'template' provided by smugglers
    \item the children often lack the skillset required to tell their stories as
        they come from small villages where everyone know everyone (-> no need
        to ever tell own story)
    \item children also struggle to communicate/explain misunderstandings to
        judge due to different realities: eg: no street light in Afghanistan
        village, so child could hide from taliban raid. Hard to believe for UK
        judge, but the child does not understand why it is hard to believe as he
        does not know that every single street/house would have lights in the UK
    \item she mention the type of room (light, airy, placement of chairs, etc)
        to avoid reproducing the sense of oppression experienced by the children
        during their journey (eg locked in the back of a lorry)
    \item refugee convention is about assessing vulnerability of children if
        they were to return -> most of the interviews while requesting asylum is
        about assessing/measuring weaknesses/vulnerabilities instead of their
        strength/resilience while they travelled the world. Harsh. need to
        'train' the children to talk about their vulnerabilities.
    \item 'is their story tainted by smugglers'? question of how genuine the
        story is. Use of robot to disclose their stories?
    \item example of Afgani children often told to claim their parents are dead
        or disappeared as they are told it could help them getting refugee
        status. Counter productive (because create inconsistencies in their
        stories) + traumatic
    \item importance of the sense of security <-> trust -> robot needs to by
        trustworthy \textbf{high level of privacy, control; privacy by design}
    \item under EU law, children must receive support to reconnect with their
        families, but almost nothing is done. Could robots help by sharing
        stories online? (potential privacy landfield, though)
\end{itemize}

develop multi-lingual capabilities.

\subsection{Long-term vision and targeted breakthrough towards that vision}

\subsubsection{Overview}

In a time where robots are on the verge of becoming pervasive in our daily human
environment, can we ensure 'by design' that robots are to become powerful tools
to foster rich, positive interactions \emph{between the people themselves}, and
build a stronger, more cohesive society? Beyond Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)
and Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), \project is a forward-looking,
ground-breaking project that aims at establishing \textbf{Robot-supported
Human-Human Interactions (r-HHI)} as the next step toward a Responsible AI: the
scientific investigation of how social robots can create, shape and support
strong, sustained, positive \emph{human-human} relationships.

'Socially intelligent' robots require unique, beyond state-of-the-art,
capabilities to \emph{(1)} understand the social interactions (social
situation awareness), \emph{(2)} decide the best course of action for
short-term and longer-term social influence, and \emph{(3)} perform the
appropriate social actions and exert appropriate, responsible social influence.

However, extreme complexity hides behind these seemingly well-delineated steps:
not only the required technology is itself beyond state-of-the-art, but the
interplay between technology, socio-cognitive psychology, privacy and ethics is
only starting to be researched and understood. \project offers a ambitious
vision and a strong, evidenced-based, methodology to significantly advance our
understanding of this \emph{wicked problem} -– a problem whose social complexity
means that it has no determinable stopping point~\cite{tonkinwise2015design}.

The \project project unfolds along three main axes:

First, the foundational ambitious of \project is to create a conceptual
framework around social robots in the human society, by reframing the widely
accepted, yet sorely unspecific, idea of \emph{human-robot interaction} into the
more specific idea of \emph{robot-supported human-human interactions}: the robot
is considered from the perspective of how it can \emph{support} humans, and in
particular, support stronger, positive interactions between humans.

My second axis is the key scientific and technical underpinning of the first
axis:  the scientific understanding and formalisation of the \emph{social
fabric} in which the robot is embedded, in its full complexity: spatial
characteristics (proxemics; group dynamics, complex, dynamic attentional
mechanisms); psycho-social characteristics (social roles and hierarchies; social
groups; mental modelling; anthropomorphic ascriptions); temporal characteristics
(effects of novelty, dynamics of anthropomorphism and mental ascriptions,
shifting group dynamics). This work will result in the formulation of a
socio-cognitive model of the social environment of the robot and the effective
implementation of the model, including the development of the technical
pre-requisites (like automatic attention tracking, face recognition, sound
localisation, etc.).

Third, an ambitious, effective demonstration of the research: the first two axis
will be applied and demonstrated on two complex, high impact scenarios. The
first scenario will takes place in Bristol's Children Hospital: a social robot
will be permanently deployed in one of ward, supporting isolated children, in
close cooperation with the hospital staff. The second scenario involves the
deployment of a social robot in a refugee camp, where it will engage with the
children to help to tell and collect the stories of their journey. This second
scenario will be co-developed in close partnership with ArtRefuge, one of the
leading charity working with refugee children in camps and safe houses.

These two application scenarios are ambitious and risky -- one could argue they
are whole projects in their own rights. Demonstrating the importance of social
modelling and the effectiveness of our model does however require complex social
situations, and complex social dynamics. These scenarios, with complementary
social situations, provide both. They also have a very high societal impact. The
Principal Investigator, Dr. Séverin Lemaignan, has been working for 12+ years in
human-robot interaction, and specifically, over the last 6 years in child-robot
interaction. His profile is both highly technical, with hundreds of hardware and
software contributions to the worldwide robotic community, and highly
experimental, running dozens of studies and experiments with children, including
long-term ones, in schools and in healthcare environments. He is in a unique
position to deliver both a scientific breakthrough on social situation
assessment for robots, and a very high-impact societal change.

\subsubsection{The case for robot-supported human-human interactions}

While the original aspiration to a
'multi-function-household-robot-that-does-the-dishes' has yet to materialise --
physical manipulation of objects in an unstructured environment is hard, as it
happens --, social robots are certainly in the process of establishing
themselves as important agents in a variety of other situations, for their
intrinsic \emph{social} features: source of comfort, tutors, entertainers. The
robot as a \emph{social agent} is a reality, within laboratories at least.

As a researcher who has been working for the last 12 years in the field of
human-robot interaction, I have been directly involved, and as a result, I have
witnessed in the crossing of a critical milestone: the emergence of
\textbf{durable social interactions} between robots (artificial intelligent
agents) and humans. Over the last two years in particular, we observe an
explosion of the number of studies involving social robots, deployed in
real-world settings (schools, care centres) over relatively long periods of time
(up to 2 or 3 months at a time). Even though these robots are rarely fully
autonomous, they do already show high levels of autonomy~\cite{emmanuel}, and complete autonomy
is in sight as well~\cite{strands}.\TODO{litt review}

While many see these developments positively, or even as a turning point [...]
other express skepticism or worry that this technology might lead to a
dehumanisation of our society. Indeed, if artificial agents are to engage into
social interactions with us, and enter what many view as a form of a 'private
domain', reserved to humans, pressing ethical questions need to be answered:

\begin{itemize}
    \item how to ensure that social robots are not used to simply replace humans
        (like social workers) to cut costs?
    \item can we guarantee that the use of social robots will always be ethically motivated?
    \item even further, can we implement some ethical safeguarding at the core
        of the system?
    \item what about privacy? how to trust that robots in our home or school or
        hospital will not eavesdrop on our private lives?
\end{itemize}

These questions are not only legitimate, but also pressing: the recent rise of
personal assistants like Alexa or Google Home, with the major privacy concerns
that accompanied their deployments in people home, shows that letting the
industry set the agenda on these questions is not wise -- and robots can
potentially be much more intrusive than non-mobile smart speakers.

Social robots have two unique properties which distinguish them from these smart
speakers, and significantly complexify their conceptual framing. First, they are
fully embodied, and they physically interact with their environment, from moving
around, to picking up objects, to looking at you; second, willingly or not, they
are ascribed \emph{agency} by people.  This second difference has far-reaching
consequences, from affective bonding to over-trust, to over-disclosure of
personnal, possibly sensitive, informations [cite paper HRI children
disclosure].



This progress raises questions, both practical and more fundamental:

inventing and building a principled cognitive architecture for tomorrow's social
robots, nutrured by decades of research in understanding human social cognition,
and where ethics and privacy are intrinsic to the system.

Due to the complex interplay between the technical implementation, the
socio-psychological determinants of the interactions, and the multiple ethical
mechanisms that have to be built-in the system, it is difficult to build one
coherent and consistent perspective on the whole question. Indeed, the
conceptual, intellectual framework emcompassing both the internal cognitive
mechanisms required by socially intelligent robots, as well as their role and
impact in the society, only exists in fragmented, disconnected pieces.

The lack of such a proper conceptual framing is a critical issue: for robots to
have a positive impact on the society, with strict ethical and privacy-related
safeguarding, it is urgent that the wider academic and intellectual communities,
beyond technologists, embrace this question and build up the debate on the
acceptability of robots in our society.

As such, the foundational ambitious of \project is to create a conceptual
framework around social robots in the human society, by reframing the widely
accepted, yet sorely unspecific, idea of \emph{human-robot interaction} into the
more specific idea of \emph{robot-supported human-human interactions}: the robot
is considered from the perspective of how it can \emph{support} humans, and in
particular, support stronger, positive interactions between humans.

Critically, though, \project will ground this conceptual frame into the reality
of socio-cognitive AI and real-world deployments of social robots.


\subsubsection{Three pilars}

To achieve the vision of a natural and harmonious \emph{co-habitation} between
social robots and humans, ...

The \project project will, for the first time, take a broad, holistic approach
to these questions, and as such, is build around three pilars:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item AI architecture for decision making
    \item socio-psychological design of the interaction, from 1-to-1
        interaction, to group interaction, to interaction with the eco-system
    \item built-in privacy and ethics
\end{enumerate}

The difficulty comes from the fact that these pilars do not represent independent
research questions: they are deeply woven together, in intricate ways.


Taken independently, these three pilars are already intrinsically complex.

The first pilar, AI Architecture for Decision Making, for instance:
state-of-the-art decision making processes for social robots are build from
multiple algorithmic layers: classical machine learning (like classifiers, or
SLAM) for low-level sensori-motor processing; probabilistic data processing (for
e.g. localisation or point cloud processing); deep neural networks for object
recognition, scene understanding, speech and dialogue processing; classical
symbolic reasoning (for instance, for task planning); high-level knowledge
representation and reasoning (semantic webs); hybrid spatial/symbolic reasoning
for motion planning; etc.

Importantly, these layers are not typically combined in a simple, linear
fashion: modern control architectures are distributed, loosely coupled, and
design so that information flows in multiple directions, at different levels of
abstraction, in order to create complex feedback loops, and achieve systems that are
both goal-directed \emph{and} reactive (event-driven).


The real complexity of such AI architectures is however striking when one tries
to answer \emph{how} such an architecture can enable the realisation of the
desired socio-cognitive functions, i.e. our second pilar. Social behaviours and
social situations are highly dynamic, loosely structured, underspecified (no
pre-made rulebook exists), uncertain.

Our best answer is for the robot to learn to become social: a human expert teaches
the robot how to socially behave, in-situ, with the robot embedded in the
interaction. I have conducted two recent and high-profile experiments in this
direction

\subsection{Evidence-based research: social robots
to support young asylum seekers on the field}


In the \project project, I will scaffold this radically novel line of
research with an original application of high societal impact: we will create a
small set of novel personal companion robots designed to facilitate human-human
interactions. These robots will be deployed in selected school to support the
social and cultural integration of vulnerable children, with a particular focus



\project will develop and demonstrate the need for a global approach to social
HRI with an ambitious, high-impact, socially meaningful application. Over the
duration of the project, I will create a new companion robot to support young,
isolated refugees in their asylum-seeking process.

The robots will be used by field practionners (charities and NGO) in refugee
camps and safe-houses across Europe to support the children by offering a
one-to-one social interaction, in their language. The robots will be designed in
close cooperation with designers and visual artists with exceptional experience
of the refugees' realities, and one of the key role of the robots will be to
collect the children's stories, as these stories are

, designed from the
ground-up with privacy and stringent ethical principles

migrant children who might lack the otherwise needed support for a successful
integration (different cultures and social norms; absence of local, culturally
integrated, relatives; language barriers; etc.).


Importance of establishing long-term trust; relation to privacy.


\subsection{The long-term vision: robot-supported human-human interactions}


\begin{figure}[!htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figs/render5-colors.png}
\end{figure}

\project is a project that aims at helping to build strong human
relationships with the help of technology.

The core idea of the project is to build small companion robots whose
aim is to facilitate human-human interactions. We want to develop these
robots with a particular application in mind: supporting the social and
cultural integration of vulnerable children in a foreign country, and in
particular, migrant children who might lack the otherwise needed support
(shared culture; already well integrated relatives) for a successful
integration.

\subsubsection{Key scientific research questions}

\begin{enumerate}
\item research the role of social influence to scaffold positive human-human
    interactions (including its ethical ramifications) in the context of migrant
    integration;
\item explore how a small robot companion can be endowed with social
    competencies to positively influence human interactions; design and
    implement the corresponding artificial social behaviours;
\item design and build a small rugged and autonomous companion robot that
    realise this goal for child-child interactions; test the technology in
    school with actual migrant children.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Vision of a novel form of interaction ``human-(robot)-human''}

\paragraph{The case of the social integration of migrant children}

A robot is left with the child when he or she starts their journey in
their new host country, and becomes a companion for the child during the
first months of the integration. Using several mechanisms that are
discussed in this proposal, the robot helps the child to gain
self-confidence, and ultimately engage in successful social interactions
with other children.

Critically, the robot is designed to support the social and cultural
integration of the child \emph{amongst her/his peers}. While the child
might build affective/emotional bonds with the robot over the course of
the support period, the robot behaviour is designed to ensure that these
bonds do not substitute themselves to the interactions with other
children.

The project combines a range of scientific and engineering endeavours to
realise within a 5-years timeframe an ambitious and bold vision for
social robotics in our society. Specifically, the project draws from the
fields of social robotics; human-robot interaction; human-machine
interaction design; and mechatronics.

While the breadth of the proposed project is significant (from
mechatronic design to long-term field testing with vulnerable
populations), the project structure minimizes the cross-dependencies
within the project, avoiding critical failure points that would put the
whole project at risk, and a careful risk assessment is conducted that
includes meaningful mitigation strategies.




\subsection{A principled architecture for socially intelligent robots}


\begin{itemize}
    \item Intrinsic social motivation: do good
    \item bottom-up grounding for situation assessment and social situation
        assessment
    \item symbolic grounding of both environment and social situation using
        'human in the loop' OR data-driven symbolic grounding
    \item knowledge representation and symbolic reasoning for dialogue
        grounding, goal planning, knowledge exchange and linked data
    \item action execution using human-in-the-loop ML
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Cross-disciplinary team, research methodology, and research
infrastructure}

The project's ambitious scientific and technical goals are expected to deliver
major scientific, societal and technical impact, that extends beyond the
boundaries of the fellowship. While ambitious, the project's feasibility is
ensured through a strong combination of cross-disciplinary expertise and
support from the host's unique research infrastructure. Scaffolded by a
participatory and iterative research methodology, and the PI experience in
managing teams and complex projects through his recognised leadership, \project
is set to deliver.

\project is indeed an interdisciplinary endeavour, and requires several
complementary expertises to be successfull. I have assembled a strong and
diverse team, with exceptional expertise both on working with vulnerable refugee
populations, and on designing social robots. The team comprises of institutional
partners with strong expertise in supporting asylum seeker (UK Refugee Council
and [Katheryn Cronin - lawyer]), charities with extensive experience using art
to support refugee populations (ArtRefuge UK), an interaction designer working
on memory collection and recollection with vulnerable children, and several
close academic collaboration: with Dave Meckin (University of the West of
England), senior researcher in media tecnologies with a unique expertise working
with vulnerable children; with Jérémy Bonvoisin (University of Bath), senior
research on sustainable and open hardware development; and finally with Katie
Winkle (University of Bristol/University of the West of England), junior
scientist with a unique expertise in social robotics.

To mirror the cross-disciplinary team, the research methodology developped for
\project will rely heavily on \emph{mutual shaping}, through co-design and
participatory design, and multi-disciplinary development sprints.

\subsubsection{Technical infrastructure}

The \project project sets an ambitious target in term of technical development.
The project indeed requires unique technical skills, both software and
hardware-wise, to create, design and build the envisonned robotic systems.

Software-wise, Dr Lemaignan, the principal investigator, is a leading
developer of software for intelligent robots, with numerous contributions to
the major software platforms used in robotic (including major contributions to
ROS, OpenCV, authoring of widely-used pieces of software like the ROS-naoqi
bridge used by hundred of researchers using the Nao and Pepper robots or the
MORSE robotic simulator). He has been teaching various modules related to
software development for robotics, and the breadth and depth of his knowledge of
robotic software development is well established. He will be leading the
software development, and, as part of the fellowship, he will also seek for
additional expert knowledge on (1) interaction design and (2) low-level
micro-programming to complete the set of required programming needs.

Hardware-wise, the Bristol Robotics Lab, where this fellowship will take place,
offer unique support and facilities for robotic hardware development: the
laboratory's dedicated equipment includes two industrial-grade rapid prototyping
machine, a laser cutter, one 5-axis digital milling machine, all the required
facilities for PCB prototyping, and a team of six full-time technicians,
specialised in hardware development. The BRL has indeed a long track-record of
designing and building new and original robots (from the BERT humanoid in the
FP7 CHRIS project, to micro-robotics [in...?], to [...]). \project will directly
benefit of this expertise, which will ensure a feasible and realistic technical
implementation of the \project robots. Besides, an hardware engineer, dedicated
to the project, will be recruited in the frame of the project.

The BRL also include a hardware incubator and is co-located with 70 start-ups
and SMEs specialising in robotic hardware and mechatronics (Bristol's
\emph{FutureSpace}). This combination of excellent research and vast industry
expertise on one site is unique in the UK, and is will play an instrumental role
in providing a coherent and strong pathway to impact to the project, including
further engagement with industrial partners and spin-off opportunities.

Dr Séverin Lemaignan is Senior Researcher at the Bristol Robotics
Laboratory, University of the West of England, Bristol. Previously, he
obtained a joint PhD in Cognitive Robotics from the CNRS/LAAS (France)
and the Technical University of Munich (Germany) for which he received
the Best PhD in Robotics 2012 award from French CNRS. He then conducted
his research as Research Fellow at EPFL (Switzerland) and Plymouth
University (UK) where he was Lecturer in Robotics until 2018. Dr Séverin
Lemaignan has been involved in several European projects related to
social and cognitive robotics: CHRIS (Cooperative Human Robot
Interaction Systems), DREAM (Development of Robot-Enhanced therapy for
children with AutisM spectrum disorders), L2TOR (Second language
TutOring using social Robots). He has also been awarded in 2015 a EU
H2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Individual Fellowship for his project

Plan to hire one mechatronics engineer and one interaction designer

Role of the mechatronics engineer: develop a novel platform, including -
chassis - power autonomy for one day - on-board compute suitable for
deep learning (NVidia TX2?) - vision (embedded RGB-D camera) - audio
processing

Role of the interaction designer: refine interaction modalities (in
particular, the non-verbal speech), details cross-modal interactions,
define interaction patterns with the child
