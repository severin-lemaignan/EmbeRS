The face of a robot represents an attentional anchor for the human user, and, if designed appropriately, enables a comfortable and intuitive communication. In this paper, we describe the user centered design process of the face display of a newly constructed humanoid robot companion called R1. We will introduce a novel solution for robotic face displays, illustrate our design decisions based on the results of an online survey, and present our final face design. We will discuss the lessons learned during the design process and argue that our solution and design will enable R1 to be a successful artificial interlocutor in different human-robot interaction scenarios.},

Our results add to growing evidence that socially assistive robots (SARs) could play a role in addressing patients' low engagement with self-directed exercise programmes. Specifically, we propose how SARs might augment or offer more pro-active assistance over existing technologies such as smartphone applications, computer software and fitness trackers also designed to tackle this issue. In addition, we present a series of design implications for such SARs based on therapists' expert knowledge and best practices extracted from our results. This includes an initial set of SAR requirements and key considerations concerning personalised and adaptive interaction strategies.},

  abstract = {We use a new model of metarepresentational development to predict a cognitive deficit which could explain a crucial component of the social impairment in childhood autism. One of the manifestations of a basic metarepresentational capacity is a [`]theory of mind'. We have reason to believe that autistic children lack such a [`]theory'. If this were so, then they would be unable to impute beliefs to others and to predict their behaviour. This hypothesis was tested using Wimmer and Perner's puppet play paradigm. Normal children and those with Down's syndrome were used as controls for a group of autistic children. Even though the mental age of the autistic children was higher than that of the controls, they alone failed to impute beliefs to others. Thus the dysfunction we have postulated and demonstrated is independent of mental retardation and specific to autism.},

number="4",
pages="200--208",
abstract="The use of concepts is fundamental to human-level cognition, but there remain a number of open questions as to the structures supporting this competence. Specifically, it has been shown that humans use concept prototypes, a flexible means of representing concepts such that it can be used both for categorisation and for similarity judgements. In the context of autonomous robotic agents, the processes by which such concept functionality could be acquired would be particularly useful, enabling flexible knowledge representation and application. This paper seeks to explore this issue of autonomous concept acquisition. By applying a set of structural and operational principles, that support a wide range of cognitive competencies, within a developmental framework, the intention is to explicitly embed the development of concepts into a wider framework of cognitive processing. Comparison with a benchmark concept modelling system shows that the proposed approach can account for a number of features, namely concept-based classification, and its extension to prototype-like functionality.",

This problem needs to be solved in any robotic system that incorporates a symbolic component. However, it is only recently that the anchoring problem has started to be addressed as a problem per se, and a few general solutions have begun to appear in the literature. This paper introduces the special issue on perceptual anchoring of the Robotics and Autonomous Systems journal. Our goal is to provide a general overview of the anchoring problem, and highlight some of its subtle points.},

  abstract  = {Ambient environments which integrate a number of sensing devices and actuators intended for use by human users need to be able to express knowledge about objects, their functions and their properties to assist in the performance of everyday tasks. For this to occur perceptual data must be grounded to symbolic information that in its turn can be used in the communication with the human. For symbolic information to be meaningful it should be part of a rich knowledge base that includes an ontology of concepts and common sense. In this work we present an integration between ResearchCyc and an anchoring framework that mediates the connection between the perceptual information in an intelligent home environment and the reasoning system. Through simple dialogues we validate how objects placed in the home environment are grounded by a network of sensors and made available to a larger KB where reasoning is exploited. This first integration work is a step towards integrating the richness of a KRR system developed over many years in isolation, with a physically embedded intelligent system.},

I'd be curious to know what kind of reasoning capability they actually have. * Their tests are conducted in a static environment. They don't take other agents into consideration (nothing like perspective taking or rich disambiguation). * No task planning at all (or at least, not discussed in this paper) More in details: - object identification based on viewpoint independent SIFT features - formalized anchoring system that explicitely match percieved attributes to predicates - Cyc predicates - ground 12 colors, based on a paper on color perception. Could be useful for us. - idem, they cite a paper on what spatial relations to compute - location of objects based on a previously provided semantic map (but not much on this semantic map) - two "memories": the robot memory stores the current list of percieved objects ; the archive memory stores what is not percieved anymore - uses directly Cyc (ie, 250 000 common sense concepts...), via CycL language -> 2nd and higher order logics (quantification over predicates, functions, etc) Remark: using 2nd order logic (ie meta statements), it would be easy to store the knowledge of each agent - disambiguation in concept name by asking human to decide amongst all concepts known by Cyc - template based natural language - experiment conducted in a "smart" indoor environmement + simple robot},

In particular, we are developing an extension to the traditional three-layered robot architecture that enables robots to interact directly at each layer -- at the behavioral level, the robots create distributed control loops; at the executive level, they synchronize task execution; at the planning level, they use market-based techniques to assign tasks, form teams, and allocate resources. We illustrate these ideas in the context of a Mars exploration scenario.},

  notes     = {- The "Ann and Sally" experiment. A child watches this scene: Ann watches Sally to put an object in a basket. Sally leaves and Ann moves the object from the basket to the table. The child is asked: where Sally will look for the object when she will return? The paper explain that children under 4 (as well as autistic children) doesn't answer "on the table" The robot can successfully pass this test if and only if it has an explicit and independent model for Sally believes on the world. So it should work with ORO. But it's a great experiment to set up! - The ToMM-SP model: Leslie proposes a general Theory of Mind Mechanism model based on what he call M-representation. M-representation are made of four components. An (1) agent, an (2) attitude (Leslie names 3 of them: to pretend, to believe or to want), an (3) "aspect of the world that anchors the agent's attitude" and the (4) content of the attitude. The example he takes is a mother that plays and uses a banana as a phone. If correctly understood by the children, this scene can be interpreted as: the (1) mother (2) pretend-true (3) the banana (4) to be a telephone. I would be curious to know your opinion about how feasible it would be to get the robot to actually understand the "mother and banana" scene. In false-belief scenarii (like the Sally-Ann one), the child must be able to attribute a false belief to the agent. Leslie adds to the model ToMM model a Selection Processing (SP) that allows the belief attributer to /inhibit/ the default (true) belief that he/she would tend to attribute to the agent. The whole model looks extremely relevant for us and I think it could be integrated in our current modelling of knowledge.},

The highest layer of the GLAIR Architecture, the Knowledge Layer (KL), contains the beliefs of the agent, and is the layer in which conscious reasoning, planning, and act selection is performed. The lowest layer of the GLAIR Architecture, the Sensori-Actuator Layer (SAL), contains the controllers of the sensors and effectors of the hardware or software robot. Between the KL and the SAL is the Perceptuo-Motor Layer (PML), which grounds the KL symbols in perceptual structures and subconscious actions, contains various registers for providing the agent's sense of situatedness in the environment, and handles translation and communication between the KL and the SAL. The motivation for the development of GLAIR has been "Computational Philosophy", the computational understanding and implementation of human-level intelligent behavior without necessarily being bound by the actual implementation of the human mind. Nevertheless, the approach has been inspired by human psychology and biology.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents an overview of a newly developed Coupled Layer Architecture for Robotic Autonomy (CLARAty), which is designed for improving the modularity of system software while more tightly coupling the interaction of autonomy and controls. First, we frame the problem by briefly reviewing previous work in the field and describing the impediments and constraints that been encountered. Then we describe why a fresh approach to the topic is warranted, and introduce our new two-tiered design as an evolutionary modification of the conventional three-level robotics architecture. The new design features a tight coupling of the planner and executive in one Decision Layer, which interacts with a separate Functional Layer at all levels of system granularity. The Functional Layer is an object-oriented software hierarchy that provides basic capabilities of system operation, resource prediction, state estimation, and status reporting. The Decision Layer utilizes these capabilities of the Functional Layer to achieve goals by expanding, ordering, initiating and terminating activities. Both declarative and procedural planning methods are used in this process. Current efforts are targeted at implementing an initial version of this architecture on our research Mars rover platforms, Rocky 7 and 8. In addition, we are working with the NASA robotics and autonomy communities to expand the scope and participation in this architecture, moving toward a flight implementation in the 2007 time-frame},

  abstract    = {This chapter describes recent theory and research in one limited area of social-cognitive development, namely, the childhood acquisition of knowledge about visual perception. The author and his co-workers have hypothesized that there are two developmental levels of such knowledge. At earlier-developing Level 1, the child understands that others as well as the self see objects, and is also able to infer correctly what objects they do or do not currently see if provided with adequate cues. At later-developing Level 2, the child understands not only that people can see objects, but also that they can have differing visual experiences while seeing the same object; most notably, they can have different spatial perspectival views of it when looking at it from different positions. Arguments and evidence for the developmental distinction between Level 1 and Level 2 knowledge are briefly presented in Section I. A more detailed model of Level 1 knowledge is presented in Section II, together with an account of several studies of its development during the first four years of life. During these early years, children appear to learn a great deal about how to produce visual percepts in others (showing and pointing to things), how to deprive others of percepts (hide objects), and how to diagnose the percepts they currently have (follow others' direction of gaze and pointing gestures). Section III similarly reviews recent theory and research on the development of Level 2 perspective-taking knowledge in older children. This work is focused mainly on the acquisition and use of very general perspective-taking rules, such as the rule that two observers who look at an object array from the same spatial position must on that account necessarily have identical perspectival views of the array. Section IV described further developmental research that could be or is being done on Level 2 knowledge, Level 1 knowledge, and on the Level 1-Level 2 distinction.},

    abstract = {Attending where others gaze is one of the most fundamental mechanisms of social cognition. The present study is the first to examine the impact of the attribution of mind to others on gaze-guided attentional orienting and its ERP correlates. Using a paradigm in which attention was guided to a location by the gaze of a centrally presented face, we manipulated participants' beliefs about the gazer: gaze behavior was believed to result either from operations of a mind or from a machine. In Experiment 1, beliefs were manipulated by cue identity (human or robot), while in Experiment 2, cue identity (robot) remained identical across conditions and beliefs were manipulated solely via instruction, which was irrelevant to the task. ERP results and behavior showed that participants' attention was guided by gaze only when gaze was believed to be controlled by a human. Specifically, the P1 was more enhanced for validly, relative to invalidly, cued targets only when participants believed the gaze behavior was the result of a mind, rather than of a machine. This shows that sensory gain control can be influenced by higher-order (task-irrelevant) beliefs about the observed scene. We propose a new interdisciplinary model of social attention, which integrates ideas from cognitive and social neuroscience, as well as philosophy in order to provide a framework for understanding a crucial aspect of how humans' beliefs about the observed scene influence sensory processing.},

abstract="This paper presents the effects of being hugged by a robot to encourage self-disclosure. Physical interactions, which are known to be essential for communication with others, also show the effects of eliciting self-disclosure from the people with whom one is interacting and contribute to the construction of social relationships. Previous research demonstrated that people who touched a robot experienced positive impressions of it without clarifying whether being hugged by a robot elicits self-disclosure from people. We developed a huge, teddy-bear-like robot that can give reciprocal hugs to people and experimentally investigated its effects on self-disclosure. Our experiment results with 32 participants showed that those who were hugged by the robot significantly offered more self-disclosure than those who were not hugged by it. Moreover, people who were hugged by the robot interacted with it longer than those who were not hugged by it. On the other hand, the perceived feelings about the robot were not significantly different between the conditions.",

        forms of dialogical research and innovation, reflections on the

In this paper we present a framework for understanding and supporting efforts aimed at ‘responsible innovation’. The framework was developed in part through work with one of the first major research projects in the controversial area of geoengineering, funded by the UK Research Councils. We describe this case study, and how this became a location to articulate and explore four integrated dimensions of responsible innovation: anticipation, reflexivity, inclusion and responsiveness. Although the framework for responsible innovation was designed for use by the UK Research Councils and the scientific communities they support, we argue that it has more general application and relevance."

abstract="The concept of responsible research and innovation (RRI) has gained prominence in European research. It has been integrated into the EU's Horizon 2020 research framework as well as a number of individual Member States' research strategies. Elsewhere we have discussed how the idea of RRI can be applied to healthcare robots (Stahl and Coeckelbergh 2016) and we have speculated what such an implementation might look like in social reality (Stahl et al. 2014). In this paper I will explore how parallel developments reflect the reasoning in RRI. The focus of the paper will therefore be on the recently published standard on ``Robots and robotic devices: Guide to the ethical design and application of robots and robotic systems'' (BSI 2016). I will analyse the standard and discuss how it can be applied to care robots. The key question to be discussed is whether and to what degree this can be seen as an implementation of RRI in the area of care robotics.",

We present a practical approach to robot knowledge representation that combines description logics knowledge bases with a rich environment model, data mining and (self-) observation modules. The robot observes itself and humans while executing actions and uses the collected experiences to learn models of action-related concepts grounded in its perception and action system. We demonstrate our approach by learning places that are involved in mobile robot manipulation actions, by locating objects based on their function and by supplying knowledge required for understanding underspecified task descriptions as commonly given by humans.},

  abstract    = {{For many years, theories of collaborative learning tended to focus on how individuals function in a group. More recently, the focus has shifted so that the group itself has become the unit of analysis. In terms of empirical research, the initial goal was to establish whether and under what circumstances collaborative learning was more effective than learning alone. Researchers controlled several independent variables (size of the group, composition of the group, nature of the task, communication media, and so on). However, these variables interacted with one another in a way that made it almost impossible to establish causal links between the conditions and the effects of collaboration. Hence, empirical studies have more recently started to focus less on establishing parameters for effective collaboration and more on trying to understand the role which such variables play in mediating interaction. In this chapter, we argue that this shift to a more process-oriented account requires new tools for analysing and modelling interactions.}},

In the first study, pedestrians were given the opportunity to subsequently help this confederate or another accomplice by calling attention to a dropped pen. In the second study, crossing speeds were timed and pedestrians were asked to record their mood and reactions to ``another pedestrian,'' who happened to be the confederate. These studies tested and found evidence for both cognitive and arousal explanations of reactions to spatial invasions. Cognitive and attributional theories imply that characteristics of the invader are important mediators of reactions to the invasion. The close nonartist was judged to be more inappropriate, produced faster escape speeds, and was helped less than the close artist or the far confederates. Arousal explanations imply that any invasion produces a generalized reaction which would be unrelated to characteristics of the invader. The other accomplice was helped less when the subject had been invaded and this reduction in helping was unaffected by the artist manipulation. These findings suggest a general arousal response to any invasion with a subsequent reliance on cognitive interpretations.},

We present a multimodal behavior generation architecture that maps high-level interactional functions and behaviors onto low-level behaviors executable by a robot. While high-level behaviors are selected based on the state of the user as well as the interaction, reinforcement learning is used within each behavior to optimize its local mapping onto lower-level behaviors. The approach is implemented and applied in a scenario in which a social robot (Furhat) assists a human player in solving a Memory game by guiding the attention of the user to target objects. Results of an evaluation study demonstrate that participants are able to solve the Memory faster with the adaptive, assistive robot.},

We propose to train a machine to build such models too. We design a Theory of Mind neural network -- a ToMnet -- which uses meta-learning to build models of the agents it encounters, from observations of their behaviour alone. Through this process, it acquires a strong prior model for agents' behaviour, as well as the ability to bootstrap to richer predictions about agents' characteristics and mental states using only a small number of behavioural observations. We apply the ToMnet to agents behaving in simple gridworld environments, showing that it learns to model random, algorithmic, and deep reinforcement learning agents from varied populations, and that it passes classic ToM tasks such as the "Sally-Anne" test (Wimmer \& Perner, 1983; Baron-Cohen et al., 1985) of recognising that others can hold false beliefs about the world.

  abstract     = {This study examines how processes of external influence shape information technology acceptance among potential users, how such influence effects vary across a user population, and whether these effects are persistent over time. Drawing on the elaboration-likelihood model (ELM), we compared two alternative influence processes, the central and peripheral routes, in motivating IT acceptance. These processes were respectively operationalized using the argument quality and source credibility constructs, and linked to perceived usefulness and attitude, the core perceptual drivers of IT acceptance. We further examined how these influence processes were moderated by users' IT expertise and perceived job relevance and the temporal stability of such influence effects. Nine hypotheses thus developed were empirically validated using a field survey of document management system acceptance at an eastern European governmental agency. This study contributes to the IT acceptance literature by introducing ELM as a referent theory for acceptance research, by elaborating alternative modes of influence, and by specifying factors moderating their effects. For practitioners, this study introduces influence processes as policy tools that managers can employ to motivate IT acceptance within their organizations, benchmarks alternative influence strategies, and demonstrates the need for customizing influence strategies to the specific needs of a user population.},

  abstract  = {This chapter presents the Elaboration Likelihood Model of persuasion (ELM) as a useful framework for interpreting and predicting the impact that health communications have on subsequent attitudes and behavior. The model proposes that attitudes can be formed as the result of different types of processes. Peripheral route processes are those that involve minimal cognitive effort and instead rely on superficial cues or heuristics as the primary bases for attitude change. Central route processes are those that involve effortful cognitive elaboration and rely on careful scrutiny of issue-relevant information and one's own cognitive responses as the primary bases for attitude change. Although each category of process can sometimes result in attitudes with similar valence, the two routes to change typically lead to attitudes with different consequences. High effort central route processes are more likely to lead to attitudes that are persistent over time, resistant to counterattack, and influential in guiding thought and behavior than are peripheral route processes. Because enduring attitude and behavioral change is likely to be a key goal of any health communication campaign, promoting attitude formation via central route processes is important. Consequently, using techniques that increase the perceived relevance of the communication and the quality of the arguments will promote achievement of a health promotion program's goals. A thorough understanding of these principles should result in more effective health communication campaigns thereby favorably influencing public health.

Model constructs were measured at three points in time at each organization: preimplementation, one month postimplementation, and three months postimplementation. The extended model was strongly supported for all four organizations at all three points of measurement, accounting for 40\%\textendash{}60\% of the variance in usefulness perceptions and 34\%\textendash{}52\% of the variance in usage intentions. Both social influence processes (subjective norm, voluntariness, and image) and cognitive instrumental processes (job relevance, output quality, result demonstrability, and perceived ease of use) significantly influenced user acceptance.

Even healthy independently living older adults experience challenges in maintaining their home [13]. Challenges with home tasks can be compensated through technology, such as home robots. However, for home robots to be adopted by older adult users, they must be designed to meet older adults' needs for assistance and the older users must be amenable to robot assistance for those needs. We conducted a needs assessment to (1) assess older adults' openness to assistance from robots; and (2) understand older adults' opinions about using an assistive robot to help around the home. We administered questionnaires and conducted structured group interviews with 21 independently living older adults (ages 65-93). The questionnaire data suggest that older adults prefer robot assistance for cleaning and fetching/organizing tasks overall. However their assistance preferences discriminated between tasks. The interview data provided insight as to why they hold such preferences. Older adults reported benefits of robot assistance (e.g., the robot compensating for limitations, saving them time and effort, completing undesirable tasks, and performing tasks at a high level of performance). Participants also reported concerns such as the robot damaging the environment, being unreliable at or incapable of doing a task, doing tasks the older adult would rather do, or taking up too much space/storage. These data, along with specific comments from participant interviews, provide the basis for preliminary recommendations for designing mobile manipulator robots to support aging in place.},

These thirteen essays explore a crucial historical question that has been notoriously hard to pin down: To what extent, and by what means, does a society's technology determine its political, social, economic, and cultural forms? Karl Marx launched the modern debate on determinism with his provocative remark that "the hand-mill gives you society with the feudal lord; the steam-mill, society with the industrial capitalist," and a classic article by Robert Heilbroner (reprinted here) renewed the debate within the context of the history of technology. This book clarifies the debate and carries it forward.Marx's position has become embedded in our culture, in the form of constant reminders as to how our fast-changing technologies will alter our lives. Yet historians who have looked closely at where technologies really come from generally support the proposition that technologies are not autonomous but are social products, susceptible to democratic controls. The issue is crucial for democratic theory. These essays tackle it head-on, offering a deep look at all the shadings of determinism and assessing determinist models in a wide variety of historical contexts. ContributorsBruce Bimber, Richard W.

Historically, and unlike the rest of Europe, the UK and Ireland have used a comparative method of disc testing to interpret susceptibility rather than one based on a correlation between MIC and zone of inhibition. Although innovative when introduced in the 1970s, Stokes' comparative method has evolved ad hoc and it has become increasingly apparent that there is a need for a standardized method of disc testing that is correlated with BSAC MIC breakpoints. The method described here, like all other standardized methods of disc testing, cannot be adapted by the user, and interpretative criteria are only applicable if the method is adhered to fully. A major advantage of this approach to susceptibility testing is that data from several sources can be combined for surveillance of resistance, a task that has been made much easier by the introduction of this method and coincides with the availability of automated zone measuring devices. It is hoped that the method described here will provide the core document for standard operating procedures; however, changes will necessarily occur over time as the method is developed and refined.},

This study focuses on the early stages of developing and testing an interactive personal trainer robot to monitor and increase exercise adherence in older adults. The robot physically demonstrates exercises for the user to follow and monitors the user's progress using a vision-processing unit that detects face and hand movements. When the user successfully completes a move, the robot gives positive feedback and begins the next repetition. The results of usability testing with 10 participants support the feasibility of this approach. Further extensions are planned to evaluate a complete exercise program for improving older adults' physical range of motion in a controlled experiment with three conditions: a personal trainer robot, a personal trainer on-screen character, and a pencil-and-paper exercise plan.},

A prospective, longitudinal study was conducted to examine Big Five personality characteristics as predictors of adherence to clinic-based rehabilitation activities following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction surgery.

Method
Participants (72 men, 36 women) completed a questionnaire assessing Big Five personality dimensions prior to surgery. For the first 7 weeks after surgery, participants' rehabilitation session attendance was recorded and rehabilitation professionals rated participants' adherence during rehabilitation sessions..

Results
Results of multiple regression analyses indicated that the 5 personality factors explained 11 percent of the variance in attendance and 17 percent of the variance in adherence ratings, that agreeableness was a significant positive predictor of attendance, and that conscientiousness and openness to experience were significant positive predictors of adherence ratings.

Conclusion
As a potential contributor to adherence, personality warrants consideration when implementing rehabilitation programs after ACL surgery.},

Two Independent observers viewed and audio-taped eight treatment sessions undertaken by two practitioners from each group.

Neuroticism was associated with a number of reported medical problems, negatively perceived health status and frequency of visits to the GP. Extraversion was associated with positive health behaviours. Openness to experience and agreeableness were associated with positive health perceptions. There were some striking differences between associations found within the male and female groups. Agreeable women reported fewer medical problems and less frequent visits to the GP than antagonistic women, whereas conscientious men reported more positive health perceptions and more visits to the GP than non-conscientious men.

Background

Chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMP) is a major health problem, accounting for approximately one-quarter of general practice (GP) consultations in the United Kingdom (UK). Exercise and physical activity is beneficial for the most common types of CMP, such as back and knee pain. However, poor adherence to exercise and physical activity may limit long-term effectiveness.

Objectives
Objectives

To assess the effects of interventions to improve adherence to exercise and physical activity for people with chronic musculoskeletal pain.

Search methods
Search methods

We searched the trials registers of relevant Cochrane Review Groups. In addition, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, PsycINFO, Science Citation Index and Social Science Citation Index and reference lists of articles to October 2007. We consulted experts for unpublished trials.

Selection criteria
Selection criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised trials evaluating interventions that aimed to improve adherence to exercise and physical activity in adults with pain for three months and over in the axial skeleton or large peripheral joints.

Data collection and analysis
Data collection and analysis

Two of the four authors independently assessed the quality of each included trial and extracted data. We contacted study authors for missing information.

Main results
Main results

We included 42 trials with 8243 participants, mainly with osteoarthritis and spinal pain. Methods used for improving and measuring adherence in the included trials were inconsistent. Two of the 17 trials that compared different types of exercise showed positive effects, suggesting that the type of exercise is not an important factor in improving exercise adherence. Six trials studied different methods of delivering exercise, such as supervising exercise sessions, refresher sessions and audio or videotapes of the exercises to take home. Of these, five trials found interventions improved exercise adherence. Four trials evaluated specific interventions targeting exercise adherence; three of these showed a positive effect on exercise adherence. In eight trials studying self-management programmes, six improved adherence measures. One trial found graded activity was more effective than usual care for improving exercise adherence. Cognitive behavioural therapy was effective in a trial in people with whiplash-associated disorder, but not in trials of people with other CMP. In the trials that showed a positive effect on adherence, association between clinical outcomes and exercise adherence was conflicting.

Authors' conclusions
Authors' conclusions

Interventions such as supervised or individualised exercise therapy and self-management techniques may enhance exercise adherence. However, high-quality, randomised trials with long-term follow up that explicitly address adherence to exercises and physical activity are needed. A standard validated measure of exercise adherence should be used consistently in future studies.},

Background

Cardiac rehabilitation is an important component of recovery from coronary events but uptake and adherence to such programs are below recommended levels. In 2010, our Cochrane review identified some evidence that interventions to increase uptake of cardiac rehabilitation can be effective but there was insufficient evidence to provide recommendations on intervention to increase adherence. In this review, we update the previously published Cochrane review.

Objectives
Objectives

To determine the effects, both harms and benefits, of interventions to increase patient uptake of, or adherence to, cardiac rehabilitation.

Search methods
Search methods

We performed an updated search in January 2013 to identify studies published after publication of the previous systematic review. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 12, 2012), MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), CINAHL EBSCO, Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S) on Web of Science (Thomson Reuters), and National Health Service (NHS) Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) databases (Health Technology Assessment (HTA) and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE)) on The Cochrane Library (Issue 4, 2012). We also checked reference lists of identified systematic reviews and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for additional studies. We applied no language restrictions.

Selection criteria
Selection criteria

Adults with myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass graft, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, heart failure, angina, or coronary heart disease eligible for cardiac rehabilitation and RCTs or quasi-randomized trials of interventions to increase uptake or adherence to cardiac rehabilitation or any of its component parts. We only included studies reporting a primary outcome.

Data collection and analysis
Data collection and analysis

At least three authors independently screened titles and abstracts of all identified references for eligibility and obtained full papers of potentially relevant trials. At least two authors checked the selection. Three authors assessed included studies for risk of bias.

Main results
Main results

The updated search identified seven new studies (880 participants) of interventions to improve uptake of cardiac rehabilitation and one new study (260 participants) of interventions to increase adherence. When added to the previous version of this review, we included 18 studies (2505 participants), 10 studies (1338 participants) of interventions to improve uptake of cardiac rehabilitation and eight studies (1167 participants) of interventions to increase adherence. We assessed the majority of studies as having high or unclear risk of bias. Meta-analysis was not possible due to multiple sources of heterogeneity. Eight of 10 studies demonstrated increased uptake of cardiac rehabilitation. Successful interventions to improve uptake of cardiac rehabilitation included: structured nurse- or therapist-led contacts, early appointments after discharge, motivational letters, gender-specific programs, and intermediate phase programs for older patients. Three of eight studies demonstrated improvement in adherence to cardiac rehabilitation. Successful interventions included: self monitoring of activity, action planning, and tailored counselling by cardiac rehabilitation staff. Data were limited on mortality and morbidity but did not demonstrate a difference in cardiovascular events or mortality except for one study that noted an increased rate of revascularization in the intervention group. None of the studies found a difference in health-related quality of life and there was no evidence of adverse events. No studies reported on costs or healthcare utilization.

Authors' conclusions
Authors' conclusions

We found only weak evidence to suggest that interventions to increase the uptake of cardiac rehabilitation are effective. Practice recommendations for increasing adherence to cardiac rehabilitation cannot be made. Interventions targeting patient-identified barriers may increase the likelihood of success. Further high-quality research is still needed.},

The aim of this research is creating an interactive framework to improve adherence to treatment in type 1 diabetic (T1D) patients based on an existing theoretical behavioral change model. The proposed framework learns from the patient's situation based on the patient's adherence to treatment and the patient's personal profile; and then the framework adapts itself to the new situation and creates new strategies to motivate the patient in order to reinforce positive behavior on the part of the patient. Thus, the embedded self-care interactive framework empowers T1D patients in achieving improved health outcomes by adhering to long term treatments.},

Third, the relevance of an appropriate patient selection for a meaningful intensive practice is explored. Finally, the paper raises the question of what it is that patients actually learn when they improve their functional skills.Search strategy. For this purpose articles from MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PEDro, DARE and PiCarta and references presented in relevant publications were examined.Discussion and conclusion. Although, there is strong evidence that early augmented exercise therapy time (expressed as time dedicated to practice) may enhance functional recovery, there is a discrepancy between the evidence for the benefits of intensive practice, on the one hand, and, the implementation of intensive rehabilitation treatment programmes in the current healthcare system on the other. Further emphasis should be given on a better understanding of the time-dependency of prognostic factors that determine the effectiveness of intensive practice in patients with stroke. In addition, a better understanding is needed of the neurophysiological and biomechanical mechanisms that underlie compensation-related learning of functional tasks after stroke.},

  abstract     = {Background and Purpose\textemdash{} To present a systematic review of studies that addresses the effects of intensity of augmented exercise therapy time (AETT) on activities of daily living (ADL), walking, and dexterity in patients with stroke.
Summary of Review\textemdash{} A database of articles published from 1966 to November 2003 was compiled from MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PEDro, DARE, and PiCarta using combinations of the following key words: stroke, cerebrovascular disorders, physical therapy, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, exercise therapy, rehabilitation, intensity, dose\textendash{}response relationship, effectiveness, and randomized controlled trial. References presented in relevant publications were examined as well as abstracts in proceedings. Studies that satisfied the following selection criteria were included: (1) patients had a diagnosis of stroke; (2) effects of intensity of exercise training were investigated; and (3) design of the study was a randomized controlled trial (RCT). For each outcome measure, the estimated effect size (ES) and the summary effect size (SES) expressed in standard deviation units (SDU) were calculated for ADL, walking speed, and dexterity using fixed and random effect models. Correlation coefficients were calculated between observed individual effect sizes on ADL of each study, additional time spent on exercise training, and methodological quality. Cumulative meta-analyses (random effects model) adjusted for the difference in treatment intensity in each study was used for the trials evaluating the effects of AETT provided. Twenty of the 31 candidate studies, involving 2686 stroke patients, were included in the synthesis. The methodological quality ranged from 2 to 10 out of the maximum score of 14 points. The meta-analysis resulted in a small but statistically significant SES with regard to ADL measured at the end of the intervention phase. Further analysis showed a significant homogeneous SES for 17 studies that investigated effects of increased exercise intensity within the first 6 months after stroke. No significant SES was observed for the 3 studies conducted in the chronic phase. Cumulative meta-analysis strongly suggests that at least a 16-hour difference in treatment time between experimental and control groups provided in the first 6 months after stroke is needed to obtain significant differences in ADL. A significant SES supporting a higher intensity was also observed for instrumental ADL and walking speed, whereas no significant SES was found for dexterity.
Conclusion\textemdash{} The results of the present research synthesis support the hypothesis that augmented exercise therapy has a small but favorable effect on ADL, particularly if therapy input is augmented at least 16 hours within the first 6 months after stroke. This meta-analysis also suggests that clinically relevant treatment effects may be achieved on instrumental ADL and gait speed.},

In contrast to the dominant technologically driven robot development process, we aim to develop a socially robust and responsible approach to robot design using Participatory Design (PD) methods. The PD process builds on participants' self-identified issues and concerns, and develops robot concepts according to participants' interpretations of the capabilities and potential applications of robotic technologies. We present methodological insights from an ongoing PD project aimed at designing socially assistive robots with older adults diagnosed with depression and their therapists, and identify remaining challenges in this project. We particularly focus on supporting mutual learning between researchers and participants and on promoting active participation of older adults as "designers" (rather than consumers) as foundational aspects of PD. We conclude with reflections regarding how this work can contribute to the further development of social robots and relevant PD methodologies.},

Using robots for rehabilitation can improve persons with physical disabilities to perform the basic activities of daily living. However, rehabilitation robots are not welcome yet in clinical environments. While surveys concerning how patients respond to robots used for rehabilitation have been conducted, no survey exists in the literature concerning how the therapists themselves think of these robotic devices, and what functionality they should possess in order to be effective. This paper presents a survey of physiotherapists concerning their thoughts, experience, and what functionality should be included in robots used for rehabilitation. In particular, the therapists were asked about the development of an intelligent robotic device capable of performing repetitive tasks for patients who suffer from reduced upper and lower limb mobility. In general, the results from this survey suggest that therapists respond positively to the idea of robotic devices in a clinical setting. Furthermore, the majority of respondents are interested in rehabilitation robotics. The results of the survey will be very helpful in the design of robotic systems for use during physiotherapy.},

Person-robot communication, viewed as a complex interactive system (CIS), is based upon three basic principles: interactivity, equifinality, and multimodality. Classification of artificial creatures from the robopsychologist's point of view divides them into two major groups: assisting robots, which are oriented toward industrial, military, research, medical, and service activities, and interactive stimulation robots, which are designed for social, educational, rehabilitation, therapeutic, and entertainment purposes. The latter class is considered the primary subject for the robotic psychology and robotherapy, approaches that have been developed by the authors. These new fields consist of a concept that places the relationships between humans and robots into a psychological, rather than technological, context. Conceptual and experimental results of implementing the robotic psychology and robotherapy concept into the study of human-robot interactions concern basic operational definitions, theoretical framework, and the design of a unified assessment tool named the Person-Robot Complex Interactive Scale (PRCIS). A study with a robotic cat provides the first results of cross-cultural analysis of person-robot communication, as well as findings on the robot's use by children, young and older adults, and elderly persons with dementia.},

With a rapidly aging population there is an increasing demand on long-term care facilities to care for older adults. Such facilities need to provide medical services, assistance in activities of daily living, and scheduled leisure activities to improve health and quality of life. However, as the need for long-term care is increasing, the care workforce is faced with decreasing numbers of healthcare staff and high turnover rates. Our research focuses on the design of socially assistive robots to plan, schedule, and facilitate social and cognitive interventions for residents in long-term care facilities. In this paper, we investigate the specific design considerations and the impressions of long-term care residents, healthcare professionals, and family members on a socially assistive robot designed to autonomously facilitate cognitively and socially stimulating leisure activities. Thematic analysis of focus group sessions conducted at a long-term care facility with the aforementioned individuals revealed important design considerations for the development and integration of a socially assistive robot in long-term care facilities.},

Results: Performance expectancy was the strongest salient construct for behavioral intention to use new technologies in rehabilitation, whereas neither effort expectancy nor social influence were salient constructs for behavioral intention to use new technologies; (4) facilitating condition and behavioral intention to use new technologies were salient constructs for current use of new technologies in rehabilitation, with facilitating condition the strongest salient for current use of new technologies in rehabilitation. Conclusion: In a large rehabilitation hospital where use of new technologies in rehabilitation is not mandatory, performance expectancy, or how the technology can help in therapists' work, was the most important factor in determining therapists' acceptance and use of technologies. However, effort expectancy and social influence constructs were not important, i.e. therapists were not influenced by the degree of difficulty or social pressures to use technologies. Behavioral intention and facilitating condition, or institutional support, are related to current use of new technologies in rehabilitation.Implications for RehabilitationRehabilitation professionals who are faced with using new technologies are less concerned about effort and social pressures, than they are about what the technologies can do for them or their clients.When it comes to new rehabilitation technologies, actual users express intention.Rehabilitation professionals' acceptance and adoption of technologies rely on conditions that facilitate their use. These conditions include scheduling, support and a conductive environment.},

The following four hypotheses: (1) Therapeutic relationships are related to functional outcome, (2) Definitions of therapeutic relationships include words and phrases expressed in the literature and by experts, (3) There are differences in perceptions of therapeutic relationships among pediatric, adult, and geriatric specialty subgroups, (4) Most occupational therapists learned skills in developing therapeutic relationships ``on the job,'' rather than during professional education, were all supported. This study reaffirms the importance of the therapeutic relationship in occupational therapy practice and provides an updated definition: A trusting connection and rapport established between therapist and client through collaboration, communication, therapist empathy and mutual understanding and respect.},

One route is based on the thoughtful consideration of arguments central to the issue, whereas the other is based on the affective associations or simple inferences tied to peripheral cues in the persuasion context. This chapter discusses a wide variety of variables that proved instrumental in affecting the elaboration likelihood, and thus the route to persuasion. One of the basic postulates of the Elaboration Likelihood Model\textemdash{}that variables may affect persuasion by increasing or decreasing scrutiny of message arguments\textemdash{}has been highly useful in accounting for the effects of a seemingly diverse list of variables. The reviewers of the attitude change literature have been disappointed with the many conflicting effects observed, even for ostensibly simple variables. The Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) attempts to place these many conflicting results and theories under one conceptual umbrella by specifying the major processes underlying persuasion and indicating the way many of the traditionally studied variables and theories relate to these basic processes. The ELM may prove useful in providing a guiding set of postulates from which to interpret previous work and in suggesting new hypotheses to be explored in future research.},

However, really few studies considered a real combination of these two dimensions and no study further investigated multidimensional models. More, most studies focused mainly on self-report to measure happiness and a deeper psychophysiological investigation on the dimensions of such an experience is still missing. A multidimensional model of happiness is presented and both the dimensions and the measures extracted within each dimension are comprehensively explained. This multidimensional model aims at being a milestone for future systematic study on psychophysiology of happiness and affective states.},

  abstract     = {PURPOSE: Exercise is an important treatment modality for persons with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but factors influencing adherence have been examined infrequently. The purpose of this investigation was to explore adherence factors to a progressive resistance exercise program for persons with COPD.
METHODS: Persons with COPD enrolled in a 12-week trial of progressive resistance exercise were invited to participate in 2 semistructured qualitative interviews exploring program adherence. Interviews were audio-taped, transcribed, and then coded independently by 2 researchers. Themes relating to short-term and long-term adherence were then developed and described.
RESULTS: Twenty-two participants were interviewed at the conclusion of the intervention (12 weeks), and 19 completed a second interview at 24 weeks. Short-term exercise adherence was facilitated by expected outcomes, self-motivation, supervision, and group support, whereas health and weather factors were the major barriers to adherence. The barriers to exercise remained unchanged at 24 weeks despite a large decline in exercise adherence. Removal of environmental support at 12 weeks may have contributed to poor long-term exercise maintenance, with participants identifying group support and regular monitoring by a therapist as the most important strategies for maintaining exercise.
CONCLUSIONS: The provision of external support in training program design appears important for persons with COPD. Longer-term adherence declined when group support and regular monitoring by a therapist was removed, despite the major perceived exercise barriers remaining unchanged. Therefore, further investigation is required to determine effective strategies for maximizing longer-term exercise adherence in this population.},

Background

Improving upper limb function is a core element of stroke rehabilitation needed to maximise patient outcomes and reduce disability. Evidence about effects of individual treatment techniques and modalities is synthesised within many reviews. For selection of effective rehabilitation treatment, the relative effectiveness of interventions must be known. However, a comprehensive overview of systematic reviews in this area is currently lacking.

Objectives
Objectives

To carry out a Cochrane overview by synthesising systematic reviews of interventions provided to improve upper limb function after stroke.

Methods
Methods

Search methods: We comprehensively searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews; the Database of Reviews of Effects; and PROSPERO (an international prospective register of systematic reviews) (June 2013). We also contacted review authors in an effort to identify further relevant reviews.
Selection criteria: We included Cochrane and non-Cochrane reviews of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of patients with stroke comparing upper limb interventions with no treatment, usual care or alternative treatments. Our primary outcome of interest was upper limb function; secondary outcomes included motor impairment and performance of activities of daily living. When we identified overlapping reviews, we systematically identified the most up-to-date and comprehensive review and excluded reviews that overlapped with this.
Data collection and analysis: Two overview authors independently applied the selection criteria, excluding reviews that were superseded by more up-to-date reviews including the same (or similar) studies. Two overview authors independently assessed the methodological quality of reviews (using a modified version of the AMSTAR tool) and extracted data. Quality of evidence within each comparison in each review was determined using objective criteria (based on numbers of participants, risk of bias, heterogeneity and review quality) to apply GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) levels of evidence. We resolved disagreements through discussion. We systematically tabulated the effects of interventions and used quality of evidence to determine implications for clinical practice and to make recommendations for future research.

Main results
Main results

Our searches identified 1840 records, from which we included 40 completed reviews (19 Cochrane; 21 non-Cochrane), covering 18 individual interventions and dose and setting of interventions. The 40 reviews contain 503 studies (18,078 participants). We extracted pooled data from 31 reviews related to 127 comparisons. We judged the quality of evidence to be high for 1/127 comparisons (transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) demonstrating no benefit for outcomes of activities of daily living (ADLs)); moderate for 49/127 comparisons (covering seven individual interventions) and low or very low for 77/127 comparisons.
Moderate-quality evidence showed a beneficial effect of constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT), mental practice, mirror therapy, interventions for sensory impairment, virtual reality and a relatively high dose of repetitive task practice, suggesting that these may be effective interventions; moderate-quality evidence also indicated that unilateral arm training may be more effective than bilateral arm training. Information was insufficient to reveal the relative effectiveness of different interventions.
Moderate-quality evidence from subgroup analyses comparing greater and lesser doses of mental practice, repetitive task training and virtual reality demonstrates a beneficial effect for the group given the greater dose, although not for the group given the smaller dose; however tests for subgroup differences do not suggest a statistically significant difference between these groups. Future research related to dose is essential.
Specific recommendations for future research are derived from current evidence. These recommendations include but are not limited to adequately powered, high-quality RCTs to confirm the benefit of CIMT, mental practice, mirror therapy, virtual reality and a relatively high dose of repetitive task practice; high-quality RCTs to explore the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), tDCS, hands-on therapy, music therapy, pharmacological interventions and interventions for sensory impairment; and up-to-date reviews related to biofeedback, Bobath therapy, electrical stimulation, reach-to-grasp exercise, repetitive task training, strength training and stretching and positioning.

Authors' conclusions
Authors' conclusions

Large numbers of overlapping reviews related to interventions to improve upper limb function following stroke have been identified, and this overview serves to signpost clinicians and policy makers toward relevant systematic reviews to support clinical decisions, providing one accessible, comprehensive document, which should support clinicians and policy makers in clinical decision making for stroke rehabilitation.
Currently, no high-quality evidence can be found for any interventions that are currently used as part of routine practice, and evidence is insufficient to enable comparison of the relative effectiveness of interventions. Effective collaboration is urgently needed to support large, robust RCTs of interventions currently used routinely within clinical practice. Evidence related to dose of interventions is particularly needed, as this information has widespread clinical and research implications.},

Background

Standing up from a seated position is one of the most frequently performed functional tasks, is an essential pre-requisite to walking and is important for independent living and preventing falls. Following stroke, patients can experience a number of problems relating to the ability to sit-to-stand independently.

Objectives
Objectives

To review the evidence of effectiveness of interventions aimed at improving sit-to-stand ability after stroke. The primary objectives were to determine (1) the effect of interventions that alter the starting posture (including chair height, foot position, hand rests) on ability to sit-to-stand independently; and (2) the effect of rehabilitation interventions (such as repetitive practice and exercise programmes) on ability to sit-to-stand independently. The secondary objectives were to determine the effects of interventions aimed at improving ability to sit-to-stand on: (1) time taken to sit-to-stand; (2) symmetry of weight distribution during sit-to-stand; (3) peak vertical ground reaction forces during sit-to-stand; (4) lateral movement of centre of pressure during sit-to-stand; and (5) incidence of falls.

Search methods
Search methods

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (June 2013), CENTRAL (2013, Issue 5), MEDLINE (1950 to June 2013), EMBASE (1980 to June 2013), CINAHL (1982 to June 2013), AMED (1985 to June 2013) and six additional databases. We also searched reference lists and trials registers and contacted experts.

Selection criteria
Selection criteria

Randomised trials in adults after stroke where: the intervention aimed to affect the ability to sit-to-stand by altering the posture of the patient, or the design of the chair; stated that the aim of the intervention was to improve the ability to sit-to-stand; or the intervention involved exercises that included repeated practice of the movement of sit-to-stand (task-specific practice of rising to stand).
The primary outcome of interest was the ability to sit-to-stand independently. Secondary outcomes included time taken to sit-to-stand, measures of lateral symmetry during sit-to-stand, incidence of falls and general functional ability scores.

Data collection and analysis
Data collection and analysis

Two review authors independently screened abstracts, extracted data and appraised trials. We undertook an assessment of methodological quality for random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessors and method of dealing with missing data.

Main results
Main results

Thirteen studies (603 participants) met the inclusion criteria for this review, and data from 11 of these studies were included within meta-analyses. Twelve of the 13 included studies investigated rehabilitation interventions; one (nine participants) investigated the effect of altered starting posture for sit-to-stand. We judged only four studies to be at low risk of bias for all methodological parameters assessed. The majority of randomised controlled trials included participants who were already able to sit-to-stand or walk independently.
Only one study (48 participants), which we judged to be at high risk of bias, reported our primary outcome of interest, ability to sit-to-stand independently, and found that training increased the odds of achieving independent sit-to-stand compared with control (odds ratio (OR) 4.86, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.43 to 16.50, very low quality evidence).
Interventions or training for sit-to-stand improved the time taken to sit-to-stand and the lateral symmetry (weight distribution between the legs) during sit-to-stand (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.34; 95\% CI -0.62 to -0.06, seven studies, 335 participants; and SMD 0.85; 95\% CI 0.38 to 1.33, five studies, 105 participants respectively, both moderate quality evidence). These improvements are maintained at long-term follow-up.
Few trials assessing the effect of sit-to-stand training on peak vertical ground reaction force (one study, 54 participants) and functional ability (two studies, 196 participants) were identified, providing very low and low quality evidence respectively.
The effect of sit-to-stand training on number of falls was imprecise, demonstrating no benefit or harm (OR 0.75, 95\% CI 0.46 to 1.22, five studies, 319 participants, low quality evidence). We judged the majority of studies that assessed falls to be at high risk of bias.

Authors' conclusions
Authors' conclusions

This review has found insufficient evidence relating to our primary outcome of ability to sit-to-stand independently to reach any generalisable conclusions. This review has found moderate quality evidence that interventions to improve sit-to-stand may have a beneficial effect on time taken to sit-to-stand and lateral symmetry during sit-to-stand, in the population of people with stroke who were already able to sit-to-stand independently. There was insufficient evidence to reach conclusions relating to the effect of interventions to improve sit-to-stand on peak vertical ground reaction force, functional ability and falls. This review adds to a growing body of evidence that repetitive task-specific training is beneficial for outcomes in people receiving rehabilitation following stroke.},

  abstract     = {During occupational therapy for children with autism, it is often necessary to elicit and maintain engagement for the children to benefit from the session. Recently, social robots have been used for this; however, existing robots lack the ability to autonomously recognize the children's level of engagement, which is necessary when choosing an optimal interaction strategy. Progress in automated engagement reading has been impeded in part due to a lack of studies on child-robot engagement in autism therapy. While there are large individual differences within the autistic population, little is known about variation across cultures. We analyzed the engagement of children (age 3-13) from two different cultural backgrounds: Asia (Japan, n=17) and Eastern Europe (Serbia, n=19). The children participated in a 25 minute therapy session during which we studied the relationship between the children's behavioural engagement (task-driven) and different facets of affective engagement (valence and arousal). Although our results indicate that there are statistically significant differences in engagement displays in the two groups, it is difficult to make any causal claims about these differences due to the large variation in age and behavioural severity of the children in the study. However, our exploratory analysis reveals important associations between target engagement and perceived levels of valence and arousal, indicating that these can be used as a proxy for the children's engagement during the therapy. We provide suggestions on how this can be leveraged to optimize social robots for autism therapy, while taking into account cultural differences.},

Secondly, PARO's positive effects on older adults' activity levels show steady growth over the duration of our study, suggesting they are not due to short-term ``novelty effects.''

The fully automatic system is first trained to predict the Big Five personality traits of each participant by extracting individual and interpersonal features from their nonverbal behavioural cues. Second, the output of the personality prediction system is used as an input to the engagement classification system. Third, we focus on the concept of ``group engagement'', which we define as the collective engagement of the participants with the robot, and analyze the impact of similar and dissimilar personalities on the engagement classification. Our experimental results show that: 1) using the automatically predicted personality labels for engagement classification yields an F-measure on par with using the manually annotated personality labels, demonstrating the effectiveness of the automatic personality prediction module proposed; 2) using the individual and interpersonal features without utilizing personality information is not sufficient for engagement classification, instead incorporating the participants and robots personalities with individual/interpersonal features increases engagement classification performance; and 3) the best classification performance is achieved when the participants and the robot are extroverted, while the worst results are obtained when all are introverted.},

Person-level cross validation shows that we are capable of detecting the engagement of the participant in question using solely the behavioural cues of the robot with a high accuracy compared to using the participant's cues himself (75.91\% vs. 74.32\%). Moreover using the behavioural cues of the other participant is also informative where it permits the detection of the engagement of the participant in question at an accuracy of 62.15\% on average. The correlation between the features of the other participant with the engagement labels of the participant in question suggests a high cohesion between the two participants. In addition, the similarity of the most significantly correlated features among the two participants suggests a high synchrony between the two parties.},

  abstract     = {This paper analyzes scientists' discourses on the social impacts and acceptability of robotics, based on data collected through participant observation and interviews with robotics researchers in the US and Japan. It shows that a linear, technologically determinist, view of the interaction between robots and society is dominant in the field; in this narrative the social impact of robotic technologies derives mostly from their technological capabilities and the aim is for society to accept and adapt to technological innovations. The framework of mutual shaping and co-production, which explores the dynamic interaction between robotics and society, is proposed as an alternative perspective on the dynamics between society and technology and a framework for envisioning and evaluating social robots. This approach focuses on analyzing how social and cultural factors influence the way technologies are designed, used, and evaluated as well as how technologies affect our construction of social values and meanings. Finally, the paper describes a range of methodologies of contextually grounded and participatory design that fit the mutual shaping framework and support a socially robust understanding of technological development that enables the participation of multiple stakeholders and disciplines.},

In such applications the success of the system is commonly evaluated by the ability to encourage the user to keep up with a task. Hence, one important requirement for supportive systems is to have an interactional motivational model that formalizes the way how users can be assisted. In this paper we describe our framework for coordinating motivational interaction scenarios with socially assistive robots (SAR) in the context of sport assistance. We exemplify three different sport scenarios where we have used the same motivational interaction model. Furthermore, we show how this model can be used to systematically test the different aspects of motivation in the context of SAR in sport domains. Therefore, we have conducted an experiment to evaluate the importance of acknowledgement from SAR for human interaction partners. The results show that users exercise longer if acknowledgment is included into the motivational model.},

The quality of this interaction is typically measured in terms of how it is engaging to the users either reflected in duration of time users spend interacting with a robot, or their self-reports on engagement during the interaction. In contrast to existing studies that analyze the influence of robots' ability to mimic affective states (happy or sad) of users on their engagement, in this paper we study the influence of sentiment apprehension by robots (i.e., robot's ability to reason about the user's attitudes such as judgment / liking) on the user engagement. Specifically, we present the findings from our pilot study on the effect of sentiment apprehension in HRI using NAO robot. In this study, we analyzed two versions of mimicry game: in the first, NAO was solely mimicking facial expressions of the users, while in the second he was also providing a feedback based on the sentiment apprehension. A total of 32 participants (7 female, 25 male) were recruited for this experiment, and the results show that the participants in the second group spent more time interacting with the robot and played more rounds of the mimicry game. After experiencing both versions of the game, ratings given by the participants indicate (with 99\% confidence) that the game with sentiment apprehension is more engaging than the baseline version.},

However, actual or anticipated pain exacerbation, and lack of confidence when doing physical activity, make it difficult to maintain and build towards long-term activity goals. Research guiding the design of interactive technology to motivate and support physical activity in people with chronic pain is lacking. We conducted studies with: (1) people with chronic pain, to understand how they maintained and increased physical activity in daily life and what factors deterred them; and (2) pain-specialist physiotherapists, to understand how they supported people with chronic pain. Building on this understanding, we investigated the use of auditory feedback to address some of the psychological barriers and needs identified and to increase self-efficacy, motivation and confidence in physical activity. We conclude by discussing further design opportunities based on the overall findings.},

We hypothesised similar effects would occur during human-robot interaction, predicting a humanoid robot's eye gaze and lifelike bodily movements (eye tracking movements and simulated ``breathing'') would increase participants' likelihood of seeking and trusting the robot's opinion in a cooperative visual tracking task. However, we instead found significant interactions between robot gaze and task difficulty, indicating that robot gaze had a positive impact upon trust for difficult decisions and a negative impact for easier decisions. Furthermore, a significant effect of robot gaze was found on task performance, with gaze improving participants' performance on easy trials but hindering performance on difficult trials. Participants also responded significantly faster when the robot looked at them. Results suggest that robot gaze exerts ``pressure'' upon participants, causing audience effects similar to social facilitation and inhibition. Lifelike bodily movements had no significant effect upon participant behaviour.},

Interactional aspects of motivation can be studied in human-human interaction (HHI) and build the basis for modeling a robot's interactional conduct. Using an ethnographic approach we explored the factors relevant in the formation of motivation-relevant processes in an indoor-cycling activity. We propose an interactive, action-based motivation model for HRI that has been implemented in an autonomous robot system and tested during a long-term HRI study. The model is based on micro-analyses of human indoor cycling courses and resulted in an adaption of specific dialog patterns for HRI. A qualitative evaluation - accompanied by a quantitative analysis - demonstrated that the transfer of interaction patterns from HHI to HRI was successful with participants benefitting from the interaction experience (e.g., performance, subjective feeling of being motivated).},

  abstract     = {Developing systems that motivate people to change their behaviors, such as an exercise application for the smartphone, is challenging. One solution is to implement motivational strategies from existing behavior change theory and tailor these strategies to preferences based on personal characteristics, like personality and gender. We operationalized strategies by collecting representative motivational text messages and aligning the messages to ten theory-based behavior change strategies. We conducted an online survey with 350 participants, where the participants rated 50 of our text messages (each aligned to one of the ten strategies) on how motivating they found them. Results show that differences in personality and gender relate to significant differences in the evaluations of nine out of ten strategies. Eight out of ten strategies were perceived as either more or less motivating in relation to scores on the personality traits Openness, Extraversion, and Agreeableness. Four strategies were perceived as more motivating by men than by women. These findings show that personality and gender influence how motivational strategies are perceived. We conclude that our theory-based behavior change strategies can be more motivating by tailoring them to personality and gender of users of behavior change systems.},

  abstract     = {Information technology (IT) acceptance research has yielded many competing models, each with different sets of acceptance determinants. In this paper, we (1) review user acceptance literature and discuss eight prominent models, (2) empirically compare the eight models and their extensions, (3) formulate a unified model that integrates elements across the eight models, and (4) empirically validate the unified model. The eight models reviewed are the theory of reasoned action, the technology acceptance model, the motivational model, the theory of planned behavior, a model combining the technology acceptance model and the theory of planned behavior, the model of PC utilization, the innovation diffusion theory, and the social cognitive theory. Using data from four organizations over a six-month period with three points of measurement, the eight models explained between 17 percent and 53 percent of the variance in user intentions to use information technology. Next, a unified model, called the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), was formulated, with four core determinants of intention and usage, and up to four moderators of key relationships. UTAUT was then tested using the original data and found to outperform the eight individual models (adjusted R of 69 percent). UTAUT was then confirmed with data from two new organizations with similar results (adjusted R of 70 percent). UTAUT thus provides a useful tool for managers needing to assess the likelihood of success for new technology introductions and helps them understand the drivers of acceptance in order to proactively design interventions (including training, marketing, etc.) targeted at populations of users that may be less inclined to adopt and use new systems. The paper also makes several recommendations for future research including developing a deeper understanding of the dynamic influences studied here, refining measurement of the core constructs used in UTAUT, and understanding the organizational outcomes associated with new technology use.},

Continuing participants scored higher than dropouts on the goals to develop recreational skills, to go out with friends, to satisfy curiosity, to release competitive drive and to develop social relationships. They also reported a greater increase in positive reactions to the program over their period of involvement in it than did the dropouts. Continuing participants rated the level of friendship within the exercise class higher and reported receiving more encouragement for involvement from their friends and work supervisor than did dropouts. Participants reported greater liking for the program activities than did the dropouts, while dropouts reported a greater dislike for the inconvenient program schedule.

It shows how researchers from a range of disciplinary backgrounds were brought together by a critique of traditional conceptions of technology (for example, `linear models' of innovation that privileged technological supply or restricted the scope of social inquiry into technology to assessing its `impacts'). Though their analytical frameworks differ to a greater or lesser extent in terminology and approach, some explanatory concepts have emerged, and constitute an effective model of the innovation process. Here, it is suggested, SST offers a deeper understanding and also potentially broadens the technology policy agenda. These claims are assessed through a review of recent research into specific instances of social shaping, particularly in relation to information technology. Finally the article discusses some of the intellectual dilemmas in the field. Though the intellectual cross-fertilisation has been creative, points of tension and divergence between its constituent strands have resulted in some sharp controversies, which reflect upon the theoretical and policy claims of SST.},

Even though this is widely known, the majority of Americans do not engage in regular physical activity and many persons who start an exercise program drop out shortly thereafter. A question of central importance is "What motivates a person to adhere to an exercise program?" A collection of quantitative and qualitative studies has shown enjoyment of exercise to be an important factor in determining adherence to exercise. Despite these findings, very little research has been conducted on factors contributing to exercise enjoyment. The purpose of this study was to examine variables believed to make such a contribution. Variables were selected based upon results of past research and theory. These were: satisfaction with the music used in the exercise environment, satisfaction with the exercise instructor, and salience of exercise role-identity (EIS). Subjects for this study were 282 female volunteers from not-for-credit aerobic dance classes at 2 university activity centers. Results revealed significant positive correlations between all 3 variables and exercise enjoyment, ranging from .34 to .45. Stepwise regression indicated that satisfaction with music (21\%) accounted for the most variance in exercise enjoyment followed by satisfaction with the instructor (8\%), and finally salience of exercise role identity (4\%). Follow-up analyses to examine specific components of satisfaction with music and the exercise instructor were also conducted.},

Background information about employment, medical history, previous exercise habits and locus of control was obtained from 40 volunteer ESRD patients who started exercise at home. Twenty-eight participants maintained the exercise programme, consisting of aerobic activity lasting an average of 25 min, four times per week, for 12 weeks. The adherent patients were found to have encouraging support groups (75 versus 25\%), to be between 41 and 60 years of age (64 versus 33\%), to have been on dialysis for between 2 and 5 years, and to have loci of control (feeling of control over life events) classed as 'internal' (68 versus 25\%). Factors such as sex, race, employment status and depression were found to have little influence on adherence. The major finding of this study was that patients adherent to exercise could be distinguished by unique psychological and psychosocial factors, and that adherence in this population was higher (70 compared with 50\%) than some estimates for the general population.},

Results showed that although many humanoid robots were criticized by most participants, some small creative humanoid robots were appreciated. However, beyond the issue of the robot appearance, many ethical and social issues were raised. These focus groups offered an opportunity for participants to discuss the very idea of an assistive robot and to challenge some implicit preconceptions of the roboticists.

  abstract   = {Will people keep the secret of a socially compelling robot who shares, in confidence, a "personal" (robot) failing? Toward answering this question, 81 adults participated in a 20-minute interaction with (a) a humanoid robot (Robovie) interacting in a highly social way as a lab tour guide, and (b) with a human being interacting in the same highly social way. As a baseline comparison, participants also interacted with (c) a humanoid robot (Robovie) interacting in a more rudimentary social way. In each condition, the tour guide asks for the secret keeping behavior. Results showed that the majority of the participants (59\%) kept the secret of the highly social robot, and did not tell the experimenter when asked directly, with the robot present. This percentage did not differ statistically from the percentage who kept the human's secret (67\%). It did differ statistically when the robot engaged in the more rudimentary social interaction (11\%). These results suggest that as humanoid robots become increasingly social in their interaction, that people will form increasingly intimate and trusting psychological relationships with them. Discussion focuses on design principles (how to engender psychological intimacy in human-robot interaction) and norms (whether it is even desirable to do so, and if so in what contexts).},

Our quantitative review provides a fundamental empirical foundation to advance both theory and practice., Method: Meta-analytic methods were applied to the available literature on trust and HRI. A total of 29 empirical studies were collected, of which 10 met the selection criteria for correlational analysis and 11 for experimental analysis. These studies provided 69 correlational and 47 experimental effect sizes., Results: The overall correlational effect size for trust was r\= = +0.26, with an experimental effect size of d\= = +0.71. The effects of human, robot, and environmental characteristics were examined with an especial evaluation of the robot dimensions of performance and attribute-based factors. The robot performance and attributes were the largest contributors to the development of trust in HRI. Environmental factors played only a moderate role., Conclusion: Factors related to the robot itself, specifically, its performance, had the greatest current association with trust, and environmental factors were moderately associated. There was little evidence for effects of human-related factors., Application: The findings provide quantitative estimates of human, robot, and environmental factors influencing HRI trust. Specifically, the current summary provides effect size estimates that are useful in establishing design and training guidelines with reference to robot-related factors of HRI trust. Furthermore, results indicate that improper trust calibration may be mitigated by the manipulation of robot design. However, many future research needs are identified.},

We examine how a positive or negative attitude from the robot, as well as whether the robot touches an interactant, affects how a robot is judged as a worker and teammate.

Our study uses a NAO robot programmed to persuade users to agree with its rankings on two tasks. We perform two manipulations: (1) The timing of conversational errors - the robot exhibited errors either in the first task, the second task, or neither; (2) The presence of social dialogue - between the two tasks, users either engaged in a social dialogue with the robot or completed a control task. We found that the timing of the errors matters: replicating previous research, conversational errors reduce the robot's influence in the second task, but not on the first task. Social dialogue interacts with the timing of errors, acting as an intensifier: social dialogue helps the robot recover from prior errors, and actually boosts subsequent influence; but social dialogue backfires if it is followed by errors, because it extends the period of good performance, creating a stronger contrast effect with the subsequent errors. The design of social robots should therefore be more careful to avoid errors after periods of good performance than early on in a dialogue.},

This paper introduces a computational model which integrates trust into robot decision-making. Specifically, we learn from data a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) with human trust as a latent variable. The trust-POMDP model provides a principled approach for the robot to (i) infer the trust of a human teammate through interaction, (ii) reason about the effect of its own actions on human behaviors, and (iii) choose actions that maximize team performance over the long term. We validated the model through human subject experiments on a table-clearing task in simulation (201 participants) and with a real robot (20 participants). The results show that the trust-POMDP improves human-robot team performance in this task. They further suggest that maximizing trust in itself may not improve team performance.},

We report the results from an online experimental study involving 200 participants. Results showed that human-robot similarity promoted trust in a robot, which led to willingness to work with robots and ultimately willingness to work with a robot over a human co-worker. However, the risk of danger moderated not only the positive link between the surface-level similarity and trust in a robot, but also the link between intention to work with the robot and willingness to work with a robot over a human co-worker. We discuss several implications for the theory of human-robot interaction and design of robots.},

Previous studies have attempted to replicate Asch's experiment with a group of robots but have failed to observe conformity [7, 25]. One explanation can be made using Hodges and Geyers work [17], in which they propose that people consider distinct criteria (truth, trust, and social solidarity) when deciding whether to conform to others. In order to study how trust and truth affect conformity, we propose an experiment in which participants play a game with three robots, in which there are no objective answers. We measured how many times participants changed their preliminary answers to match the group of robots' in their final answer. We conducted a between-subjects study (N = 30) in which there were two conditions: one in which participants saw the group of robots' preliminary answer before deciding their final answer, and a control condition in which they did not know the robots' preliminary answer. Participants in the experimental condition conformed significantly more (29\%) than participants in the control condition (6\%). Therefore we have shown that groups of robots can cause people to conform to them. Additionally trust plays a role in conformity: initially, participants conformed to robots at a similar rate to Asch's participants, however, many participants stop conforming later in the game when trust is lost due to the robots choosing an incorrect answer.},

A robot told a classical persuasive story about the consequences of lying to forty-eight participants, and was programmed to use (persuasive) gestures (or not) and gazing (or not). Next, we asked participants to evaluate the character in the story thereby assessing the robot's persuasiveness. Results presented evidence a robot's persuasiveness is increased when gazing is used. When the robot used gestures, its persuasiveness only increased when it also used gazing. When the robot did not use gazing, using gestures diminished the robot's persuasiveness.

Persuasion can be generally defined as an attempt to change another's beliefs or behavior. The act of influencing others is fundamental to nearly every type of social interaction. Any agent desiring to seamlessly operate in a social manner will need to incorporate this type of core human behavior. As in human interaction, myriad aspects of a humanoid robot's appearance and behavior can significantly alter its persuasiveness - this work will focus on one particular factor: gender. In the current study, run at the Museum of Science in Boston, subjects interacted with a humanoid robot whose gender was varied. After a short interaction and persuasive appeal, subjects responded to a donation request made by the robot, and subsequently completed a post-study questionnaire. Findings showed that men were more likely to donate money to the female robot, while women showed little preference. Subjects also tended to rate the robot of the opposite sex as more credible, trustworthy, and engaging. In the case of trust and engagement the effect was much stronger between male subjects and the female robot. These results demonstrate the importance of considering robot and human gender in the design of HRI.},

  abstract     = {Two experiments investigated the hypothesis that strategic behavioral mimicry can facilitate negotiation outcomes. Study 1 used an employment negotiation with multiple issues, and demonstrated that strategic behavioral mimicry facilitated outcomes at both the individual and dyadic levels: Negotiators who mimicked the mannerisms of their opponents both secured better individual outcomes, and their dyads as a whole also performed better when mimicking occurred compared to when it did not. Thus, mimickers created more value and then claimed most of that additional value for themselves, though not at the expense of their opponents. In Study 2, mimicry facilitated negotiators' ability to uncover underlying compatible interests and increased the likelihood of obtaining a deal in a negotiation where a prima facie solution was not possible. Results from Study 2 also demonstrated that interpersonal trust mediated the relationship between mimicry and deal-making. Implications for our understanding of negotiation dynamics and interpersonal coordination are discussed.},

Following the appeal, participants completed a posttest attitude survey and a series of questionnaires designed to assess perceptions of speech qualities, perceptions of the speaker, and perceptions of the message. The human voice was generally perceived more favorably than the computer-synthesized voice, and the speaker was perceived more favorably when the voice was a human voice than when it was computer synthesized. There was, however, no evidence that computerized speech, as compared with the human voice, affected persuasion or perceptions of the message.

Manipulations of speech rate were crossed with (a) credibility of the speaker and (b) complexity of the spoken message. Results suggest that speech rate functions as a general cue that augments credibility; rapid speech enhances persuasion, and therefore argues against information-processing interpretations of the effects of a fast speaking rate. When novel speech content was used in Exp II to prevent simple retrieval of stock counterarguments, it was observed that increased persuasion produced by fast speech could not be attributed to disruption of effective counterarguing. It is concluded that findings emphasize the importance of perceptual and evaluative factors in the persuasion process at the expense of a more rationalistic information-processing view of how man responds when confronted with an influence attempt.

The home becomes a place where people care for each other, and it gradually subsumes all activities. This article reports on an ethnographic study of aging adults who live independently in their homes. Seventeen elders aged 60 through 90 were interviewed and observed in their homes in 2 Midwestern cities. The goal is to understand how robotic products might assist these people, helping them to stay independent and active longer. The experience of aging is described as an ecology of aging made up of people, products, and activities taking place in a local environment of the home and the surrounding community. In this environment, product successes and failures often have a dramatic impact on the ecology, throwing off a delicate balance. When a breakdown occurs, family members and other caregivers have to intervene, threatening elders' independence and identity. This article highlights the interest in how the elder ecology can be supported by new robotic products that are conceived of as a part of this interdependent system. It is recommended that the design of these products fit the ecology as part of the system, support elders' values, and adapt to all of the members of the ecology who will interact with them.},

The study took place over the course of three months, during which PARO was placed in a publicly accessibly space where participants could interact with it freely. Social shaping focuses attention on social factors that affect the use and interpretation of technology in particular contexts. We therefore aimed to understand how different social actors make sense of and use PARO in daily interaction. Our results show participant gender, social mediation, and individual sense making led to differential use and interpretation of the robot, which affected the success of human-robot interactions. We also found that exposure to others interacting with PARO affected the nursing staff's perceptions of robots and their potential usefulness in eldercare. This shows that social shaping theory provides a valuable perspective for understanding the implementation of robots in long-term HRI and can inform interaction design in this domain.},

  abstract     = {Background Physical inactivity is highly prevalent after stroke, increasing the risk of poor health outcomes including recurrent stroke. Tailoring of exercise programs to individual preferences can improve adherence, but no tools exist for this purpose in stroke. Methods We identified potential questionnaire items for establishing exercise preferences via: (i) our preliminary Exercise Preference Questionnaire in stroke, (ii) similar tools used in other conditions, and (iii) expert panel consultations. The resulting 35-item questionnaire (SEPI-35) was administered to stroke survivors, along with measures of disability, depression, anxiety, fatigue and self-reported physical activity. Exploratory factor analysis was used to identify a factor structure in exercise preferences, providing a framework for item reduction. Associations between exercise preferences and personal characteristics were analysed using multivariable regression. Results A group of 134 community-dwelling stroke survivors (mean age 64.0, SD 13.3) participated. Analysis of the SEPI-35 identified 7 exercise preference factors (Supervision-support, Confidence-challenge, Health-wellbeing, Exercise context, Home-alone, Similar others, Music-TV). Item reduction processes yielded a 13-item version (SEPI-13); in analysis of this version, the original factor structure was maintained. Lower scores on Confidence-challenge were significantly associated with disability (p = 0.002), depression (p = 0.001) and fatigue (p = 0.001). Self-reported barriers to exercise were particularly prevalent in those experiencing fatigue and anxiety. Conclusions The SEPI-13 is a brief instrument that allows assessment of exercise preferences and barriers in the stroke population. This new tool can be employed by health professionals to inform the development of individually tailored exercise interventions.},

To investigate the effects of some key nonverbal gestures on a human's own engagement and robot engagement experienced by humans, participants read a series of instructions to a robot that responded with nods, blinks, changes in gaze direction, or a combination of these. Unbeknown to the participants, the robot had no form of speech processing or gesture recognition, but simply measured speech volume levels, responding with gestures whenever a lull in sound was detected. As measured by visual analogue scales, engagement of participants was not differentially affected by the different responses of the robot. However, their perception of the robot's engagement in the task, its likability and its understanding of the instructions depended on the gesture presented, with nodding being the most effective response. Participants who self-reported greater robotics knowledge reported higher overall engagement and greater success at developing a relationship with the robot. However, self-reported robotics knowledge did not differentially affect the impact of robot gestures. This suggests that greater familiarity with robotics may help to maximise positive experiences for humans involved in human\textendash{}robot interactions without affecting the impact of the type of signal sent by the robot.},

An integrative model of dehumanisation is then laid out, in which distinct forms of dehumanisation correspond to the denial of the two senses of humanness, and the likening of people to particular kinds of nonhuman entities (animals and machines). Studies demonstrating that human nature attributes are ascribed more to the self than to others are reviewed, along with evidence of the phenomenon's cognitive and motivational basis. Research also indicates that both kinds of humanness are commonly denied to social groups, both explicitly and implicitly, and that they may cast a new light on the study of stereotype content. Our approach to the study of dehumanisation complements the tradition of research on infrahumanisation, and indicates new directions for exploring the importance of humanness as a dimension of social perception.},

Twenty-eight participants interacted with a robot in two experimental conditions in which the robot's behaviour was varied. Reliability analysis and a PCA was performed on the NARS items, creating three new subscales. Correlations between the subscales and other evaluations of the robot's behaviour found meaningful results, supporting the use of the NARS in English speaking samples.},

An interaction effect revealed that studies conducted on a desktop that used objective measures showed a stronger effect for agency than those that were conducted on a desktop but used subjective measures.

Mimicry increased empathy toward the Palestinians, irrespective of participants' feelings toward the Palestinians prior to the experiment. Further, mimicked participants who reported a priori negative feelings toward Palestinians expressed more sympathy toward their Palestinian virtual interaction partner, rated themselves as closer to him, and perceived the interaction as more harmonious compared to participants in a counter-mimicry condition. The results underscore the impact of mimicry on intergroup interactions, especially on individuals who harbor negative feelings toward the outgroup.

To test this effect to the domain of social robots, we conducted an experiment with 61 Caucasian (White) American participants who rated either a robot that resembled the participants' Caucasian ingroup or a social outgroup on mind perception (i.e., the attribution of agency and experience). First, we predicted that the ingroup robot would be evaluated more positively than the outgroup robot. Moreover, we assessed the Caucasian Americans' endorsement of anti-Black prejudice. Thus, second, we hypothesized interaction effects of robot type and level of prejudice on mind perception, meaning that effects of ingroup bias should be particularly pronounced under high (vs. low) levels of self-reported Anti- Black prejudice. Interestingly, we did not obtain main effects for robot type on mind perception. Contrary to our hypothesis, participants even seemed to attribute more agency and experience to the outgroup robot relative to the ingroup robot. As expected, no main effects for levels of prejudice on mind perception emerged. Importantly, however, we obtained the predicted interaction effects on the central dependent measures. Obviously, the interplay of design choices and user attitudes may bias anthropomorphic inferences about robot companions, posing a psychological barrier to human-robot companionship and pleasant human-robot interaction.},

We used an innovative methodology that consisted of three steps: (a) identifying conceptual-ethical questions, (b) conducting a literature search, and (c) identifying, describing and analyzing the ethical arguments in connection with the conceptual-ethical questions.
Results
Twenty-eight appropriate publications were identified. All were published between 2002 and 2016. Four primary ethical approaches were distinguished: (a) a deontological, (b) a principlist, (c) an objective-list, and (d) a care-ethical. All approaches were equally represented across the articles, and all used similar concepts that grounded their diverse ethical arguments. A small group of publications could not be linked to an ethical approach.
Conclusions
All included publications presented a strong ethical rationale based on fully elaborated normative arguments. Although the reviewed studies used similar grounding concepts, the studies' arguments were very diverse and sometimes diametrically opposed. Our analysis shows how one envisions care robot use in aged-care settings is influenced by how one views the traditional boundaries of the ethical landscape in aged care. We suggest that an ethical analysis of care robot use employs ``democratic spaces,'' in which all stakeholders in aged care, especially care recipients, have a voice in the ethical debate.},

In broad terms, the theory is found to be well supported by empirical evidence. Intentions to perform behaviors of different kinds can be predicted with high accuracy from attitudes toward the behavior, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control; and these intentions, together with perceptions of behavioral control, account for considerable variance in actual behavior. Attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control are shown to be related to appropriate sets of salient behavioral, normative, and control beliefs about the behavior, but the exact nature of these relations is still uncertain. Expectancy-value formulations are found to be only partly successful in dealing with these relations. Optimal rescaling of expectancy and value measures is offered as a means of dealing with measurement limitations. Finally, inclusion of past behavior in the prediction equation is shown to provide a means of testing the theory's sufficiency, another issue that remains unresolved. The limited available evidence concerning this question shows that the theory is predicting behavior quite well in comparison to the ceiling imposed by behavioral reliability.},

Recent researches discussed the effect of personality traits on the verbal and nonverbal production, which plays a major role in transferring and understanding messages in a social interaction between a human and a robot. The characteristics of the generated gestures (e.g., amplitude, direction, rate, and speed) during the nonverbal communication can differ according to the personality trait, which, similarly, influences the verbal content of the human speech in terms of verbosity, repetitions, etc. Therefore, our research tries to map a human's verbal behavior to a corresponding combined robot's verbal-nonverbal behavior based on the personality dimensions of the interacting human. The system estimates first the interacting human's personality traits through a psycholinguistic analysis of the spoken language, then it uses PERSONAGE natural language generator that tries to generate a corresponding verbal language to the estimated personality traits. Gestures are generated by using BEAT toolkit, which performs a linguistic and contextual analysis of the generated language relying on rules derived from extensive research into human conversational behavior. We explored the human-robot personality matching aspect and the differences of the adapted mixed robot's behavior (gesture and speech) over the adapted speech only robot's behavior in an interaction. Our model validated that individuals preferred more to interact with a robot that had the same personality with theirs and that an adapted mixed robot's behavior (gesture and speech) was more engaging and effective than a speech only robot's behavior. Our experiments were done with Nao robot.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a review of the contemporary robotics research with respect to making robots and human\textendash{}robot interaction (HRI) useful for autism intervention in clinical settings. Robotics research over the past decade has demonstrated that many children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) have a strong interest in robots and robot toys and can connect with a robot significantly better than with a human. Despite showing great promise, research in this direction has made minimal progress in advancing robots as clinically useful for ASD intervention. Moreover, the clinicians are generally not convinced about the potential of robots. A major reason behind this is that a vast majority of HRI studies on robot-mediated intervention (RMI) do not follow any standard research design and, consequently, the data produced by these studies is minimally appealing to the clinical community. In clinical research on ASD intervention, a systematic evaluation of the evidence found from a study is performed to determine the effectiveness of an experimental intervention (e.g., a RMI). An intervention that produces a stable positive effect is considered as an evidence-based practice (EBP) in autism. EBPs enable clinicians to choose the best available treatments for an individual with ASD. The ultimate goal of RMI, therefore, is to be considered as an EBP so that they can actually be used for treating autism. There are several criteria to measure the strength of evidence, and they are mostly geared toward rigorous research design. The research on RMI, therefore, needs to follow standard research design to be acceptable by the clinical community. This paper reviews the contemporary literature on robotics and autism to understand the status of RMI with respect to being an EBP in autism treatment. First, a set of guidelines is reported which is considered as a benchmark for research design in clinical research on ASD intervention and can easily be adopted in HRI studies on RMI. The existing literature on RMI is then reviewed with respect to these guidelines. We hope that the guidelines reported in this paper will help the robotics community to design user studies on RMI that meet clinical standards and thereby produce results that can lead RMI toward being considered as an EBP in autism. Note that the paper is exclusively focused on the role of robots in ASD intervention/therapy. Reviews on the use of robots in ASD diagnosis are beyond the scope of this paper.},

Two studies are reported which examined the associations between five major personality dimensions and four major health behavior dimensions. Prior associations between health behaviors and neurotic and extraverted personality tendencies generally were replicated. However, Conscientiousness and Agreeableness, two domains of personality that have received little research attention, emerged as important personality predictors of health behaviors. The results indicate that personality is a reliable predictor of health behavior patterns. It is suggested that the importance of personality has been underestimated in past research by the failure to consider appropriate health behavior criteria and the omission of important personality dimensions, such as Conscientiousness and Agreeableness, when studying health behavior patterns.},

Background

Contracts are a verbal or written agreement that a patient makes with themselves, with healthcare practitioners, or with carers, where participants commit to a set of behaviours related to the care of a patient. Contracts aim to improve the patients' adherence to treatment or health promotion programmes.

Objectives
Objectives

To assess the effects of contracts between patients and healthcare practitioners on patients' adherence to treatment, prevention and health promotion activities, the stated health or behaviour aims in the contract, patient satisfaction or other relevant outcomes, including health practitioner behaviour and views, health status, reported harms, costs, or denial of treatment as a result of the contract.

Search methods
Search methods

We searched: the Cochrane Consumers and Communication Review Group's Specialised Register (in May 2004); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), (The Cochrane Library 2004, issue 1); MEDLINE 1966 to May 2004); EMBASE (1980 to May 2004); PsycINFO (1966 to May 2004); CINAHL (1982 to May 2004); Dissertation Abstracts. A: Humanities and Social Sciences (1966 to May 2004); Sociological Abstracts (1963 to May 2004); UK National Research Register (2000 to May 2004); and C2-SPECTR, Campbell Collaboration (1950 to May 2004).

Selection criteria
Selection criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing the effects of contracts between healthcare practitioners and patients or their carers on patient adherence, applied to diagnostic procedures, therapeutic regimens or any health promotion or illness prevention initiative for patients. Contracts had to specify at least one activity to be observed and a commitment of adherence to it. We included trials comparing contracts with routine care or any other intervention.

Data collection and analysis
Data collection and analysis

Selection and quality assessment of trials were conducted independently by two review authors; single data extraction was checked by a statistician. We present the data as a narrative summary, given the wide range of interventions, participants, settings and outcomes, grouped by the health problem being addressed.

Main results
Main results

We included thirty trials, all conducted in high income countries, involving 4691 participants. Median sample size per group was 21. We examined the quality of each trial against eight standard criteria, and all trials were inadequate in relation to three or more of these standards. Trials evaluated contracts in addiction (10 trials), hypertension (4 trials), weight control (3 trials) and a variety of other areas (13 trials). Fifteen trials reported at least one outcome that showed statistically significant differences favouring the contracts group, six trials reported at least one outcome that showed differences favouring the control group and 26 trials reported at least one outcome without differences between groups. Effects on adherence were not detected when measured over longer periods.

Authors' conclusions
Authors' conclusions

There is limited evidence that contracts can potentially contribute to improving adherence, but there is insufficient evidence from large, good quality studies to routinely recommend contracts for improving adherence to treatment or preventive health regimens.},

  abstract  = {Discovering older adults' perceptions and expectations of domestic care service robots are vital in informing the design and development of new technologies to ensure acceptability and usability. This paper identifies issues that were elicited from older adults using different methods to promote creative thinking about domestic robots at an emotional level, as well as pragmatic level. These included exploring people's ideal embodiment preferences and requirements for a domestic care service robot, and also what embodiments and functional aspects will not be acceptable. We analysed our findings using relevant constructs from the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology, and Technology Acceptance models. In addition to some already well-established findings, we discovered some surprising aspects concerning interaction, behaviour and appearance and the ability for the robot to fit the relevant context, both physically and conceptually.},

This paper explores the use of cameras as cultural probes for gaining this understanding. In this study, probes were included as part of the requirements elicitation methodology for an EU FP7 research project, MOBISERV, developing an integrated intelligent home environment for the provision of health, nutrition and mobility services for older adults. During the initial phase of the project, modelling user requirements for MOBISERV components, disposable cameras were adopted as one of several methods for eliciting information. They were given to older adults (potential end users of the system) enabling them to provide an insight into personal aspects of their own lives. This paper presents the approach and gives a description and evaluation of the method used, considering the information obtained and its impact on enabling contextualisation of the issues and raising awareness of user needs.},

All 3 experiments included a condition in which a requester first asked for an extreme favor (which was refused to him) and then for a smaller favor. In each instance, this procedure produced more compliance with the smaller favor than a procedure in which the requester asked solely for the smaller favor. Additional control conditions in each experiment support the hypothesis that the effect is mediated by a rule for reciprocation of concessions. Several advantages to the use of the rejection-then-moderation procedure for producing compliance are discussed.},

In this paper, we present the design of a novel control architecture for the robot Brian 2.0, which enables the robot to be a social motivator by providing assistance, encouragement and celebration during an activity. A hierarchical reinforcement learning approach is used in the architecture to allow the robot to: 1) learn appropriate assistive behaviours based on the structure of the activity, and 2) personalize an interaction based on user states. Experiments show that the control architecture is effective in determining the robot's optimal assistive behaviours during a memory game interaction.},

Participants were 264 undergraduate students who completed a battery of self-administered questionnaires including the NEO Five-Factor Inventory (Costa \& McCrae, 1992) and the Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire (Godin \& Shephard, 1985). Consistent with hypotheses, the results of the study indicated that: 1.(a) extraversion and conscientiousness were positively related whereas neuroticism was negatively related to exercise behavior,2.(b) each ``Big Five'' dimension correlated with theoretically expected exercise motives,3.(c) neuroticism and conscientiousness were the personality dimensions most consistently related to exercise barriers4.(d) all ``Big Five'' personality dimensions were related to some aspect of preferences for exercise context and structure. It was concluded that the FFM may be a useful framework for understanding not only how much exercise people perform, but also their exercise motives, barriers, and preferences.},

Background

With an increased focus on home-based stroke services and the undertaking of programmes, targeted at upper limb recovery within clinical practice, a systematic review of home-based therapy programmes for individuals with upper limb impairment following stroke was required.

Objectives
Objectives

To determine the effects of home-based therapy programmes for upper limb recovery in patients with upper limb impairment following stroke.

Search methods
Search methods

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group's Specialised Trials Register (May 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1950 to May 2011), EMBASE (1980 to May 2011), AMED (1985 to May 2011) and six additional databases. We also searched reference lists and trials registers.

Selection criteria
Selection criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in adults after stroke, where the intervention was a home-based therapy programme targeted at the upper limb, compared with placebo, or no intervention or usual care. Primary outcomes were performance in activities of daily living (ADL) and functional movement of the upper limb. Secondary outcomes were performance in extended ADL and motor impairment of the arm.

Data collection and analysis
Data collection and analysis

Two review authors independently screened abstracts, extracted data and appraised trials. We undertook assessment of risk of bias in terms of method of randomisation and allocation concealment (selection bias), blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias), whether all the randomised patients were accounted for in the analysis (attrition bias) and the presence of selective outcome reporting.

Main results
Main results

We included four studies with 166 participants. No studies compared the effects of home-based upper limb therapy programmes with placebo or no intervention. Three studies compared the effects of home-based upper limb therapy programmes with usual care. Primary outcomes: we found no statistically significant result for performance of ADL (mean difference (MD) 2.85; 95\% confidence interval (CI) -1.43 to 7.14) or functional movement of the upper limb (MD 2.25; 95\% CI -0.24 to 4.73)). Secondary outcomes: no statistically significant results for extended ADL (MD 0.83; 95\% CI -0.51 to 2.17)) or upper limb motor impairment (MD 1.46; 95\% CI -0.58 to 3.51). One study compared the effects of a home-based upper limb programme with the same upper limb programme based in hospital, measuring upper limb motor impairment only; we found no statistically significant difference between groups (MD 0.60; 95\% CI -8.94 to 10.14).

Authors' conclusions
Authors' conclusions

There is insufficient good quality evidence to make recommendations about the relative effect of home-based therapy programmes compared with placebo, no intervention or usual care.},

  abstract     = {Valid measurement scales for predicting user acceptance of computers are in short supply. Most subjective measures used in practice are unvalidated, and their relationship to system usage is unknown. The present research develops and validates new scales for two specific variables, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, which are hypothesized to be fundamental determinants of user acceptance. Definitions for these two variables were used to develop scale items that were pretested for content validity and then tested for reliability and construct validity in two studies involving a total of 152 users and four application programs. The measures were refined and stream-lined, resulting in two six-item scales with reliabilities of.98 for usefulness and.94 for ease of use. The scales exhibited high convergent, discriminant, and factorial validity. Perceived usefulness was significantly correlated with both self-reported current usage (r=.63, Study 1) and self-predicted future usage (r=.85, Study 2). Perceived ease of use was also significantly correlated with current usage (r=.45, Study 1) and future usage (r=.59, Study 2). In both studies, usefulness had a significantly greater correlation with usage behavior than did ease of use. Regression analyses suggest that perceived ease of use may actually be a causal antecedent to perceived usefulness, as opposed to a parallel, direct determinant of system usage. Implications are drawn for future research on user acceptance.},

Background

It has been recognized that poor adherence can be a serious risk to the health and wellbeing of patients, and greater adherence to dietary advice is a critical component in preventing and managing chronic diseases.

Objectives
Objectives

To assess the effects of interventions for enhancing adherence to dietary advice for preventing and managing chronic diseases in adults.

Search methods
Search methods

We searched the following electronic databases up to 29 September 2010: The Cochrane Library (issue 9 2010), PubMed, EMBASE (Embase.com), CINAHL (Ebsco) and PsycINFO (PsycNET) with no language restrictions. We also reviewed: a) recent years of relevant conferences, symposium and colloquium proceedings and abstracts; b) web-based registries of clinical trials; and c) the bibliographies of included studies.

Selection criteria
Selection criteria

We included randomized controlled trials that evaluated interventions enhancing adherence to dietary advice for preventing and managing chronic diseases in adults. Studies were eligible if the primary outcome was the client's adherence to dietary advice. We defined 'client' as an adult participating in a chronic disease prevention or chronic disease management study involving dietary advice.

Data collection and analysis
Data collection and analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of the studies. They also assessed the risk of bias and extracted data using a modified version of the Cochrane Consumers and Communication Review Group data extraction template. Any discrepancies in judgement were resolved by discussion and consensus, or with a third review author. Because the studies differed widely with respect to interventions, measures of diet adherence, dietary advice, nature of the chronic diseases and duration of interventions and follow-up, we conducted a qualitative analysis. We classified included studies according to the function of the intervention and present results in a narrative table using vote counting for each category of intervention.

Main results
Main results

We included 38 studies involving 9445 participants. Among studies that measured diet adherence outcomes between an intervention group and a control/usual care group, 32 out of 123 diet adherence outcomes favoured the intervention group, 4 favoured the control group whereas 62 had no significant difference between groups (assessment was impossible for 25 diet adherence outcomes since data and/or statistical analyses needed for comparison between groups were not provided). Interventions shown to improve at least one diet adherence outcome are: telephone follow-up, video, contract, feedback, nutritional tools and more complex interventions including multiple interventions. However, these interventions also shown no difference in some diet adherence outcomes compared to a control/usual care group making inconclusive results about the most effective intervention to enhance dietary advice. The majority of studies reporting a diet adherence outcome favouring the intervention group compared to the control/usual care group in the short-term also reported no significant effect at later time points. Studies investigating interventions such as a group session, individual session, reminders, restriction and behaviour change techniques reported no diet adherence outcome showing a statistically significant difference favouring the intervention group. Finally, studies were generally of short duration and low quality, and adherence measures varied widely.

Authors' conclusions
Authors' conclusions

There is a need for further, long-term, good-quality studies using more standardized and validated measures of adherence to identify the interventions that should be used in practice to enhance adherence to dietary advice in the context of a variety of chronic diseases.},

In field-experiment 1, agents tried to persuade participants in buying a candybox by using an approach-oriented strategy (Door-In-The-Face, DITF). An eager nonverbal style increased the impact of the DITF, whereas vigilant nonverbal cues rendered it ineffective. Conversely, field-experiment 2 showed that an avoidance-oriented strategy (Disrupt-Then-Reframe) benefited from being presented in a vigilant, rather than an eager nonverbal style, which similarly attenuated its impact. Hence, eager nonverbal cues promote the effectiveness of approach-oriented influence strategies whereas vigilant cues do the opposite and increase the impact of avoidance-oriented influence strategies.},

We found that a human observer elicits less attention than a robot, but evokes more of a socially normative presence causing people to act honestly.

We address the task of estimating the engagement state of customers for a robot bartender based on the data from audiovisual sensors. We begin with an offline experiment using hidden Markov models, confirming that the sensor data contains the information necessary to estimate user state. We then present two strategies for online state estimation: a rule-based classifier based on observed human behaviour in real bars, and a set of supervised classifiers trained on a labelled corpus. These strategies are compared in offline cross-validation, in an online user study, and through validation against a separate test corpus. These studies show that while the trained classifiers are best in a cross-validation setting, the rule-based classifier performs best with novel data; however, all classifiers also change their estimate too frequently for practical use. To address this issue, we present a final classifier based on Conditional Random Fields: this model has comparable performance on the test data, with increased stability. In summary, though, the rule-based classifier shows competitive performance with the trained classifiers, suggesting that for this task, such a simple model could actually be a preferred option, providing useful online performance while avoiding the implementation and data-scarcity issues involved in using machine learning for this task.},

Background

Repetitive task training (RTT) involves the active practice of task-specific motor activities and is a component of current therapy approaches in stroke rehabilitation.

Objectives
Objectives

Primary objective: To determine if RTT improves upper limb function/reach and lower limb function/balance in adults after stroke.

Secondary objectives: 1) To determine the effect of RTT on secondary outcome measures including activities of daily living, global motor function, quality of life/health status and adverse events. 2) To determine the factors that could influence primary and secondary outcome measures, including the effect of 'dose' of task practice; type of task (whole therapy, mixed or single task); timing of the intervention and type of intervention.

Search methods
Search methods

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (4 March 2016); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library 2016, Issue 5: 1 October 2006 to 24 June 2016); MEDLINE (1 October 2006 to 8 March 2016); Embase (1 October 2006 to 8 March 2016); CINAHL (2006 to 23 June 2016); AMED (2006 to 21 June 2016) and SPORTSDiscus (2006 to 21 June 2016).

Selection criteria
Selection criteria

Randomised/quasi-randomised trials in adults after stroke, where the intervention was an active motor sequence performed repetitively within a single training session, aimed towards a clear functional goal.

Data collection and analysis
Data collection and analysis

Two review authors independently screened abstracts, extracted data and appraised trials. We determined the quality of evidence within each study and outcome group using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool and GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) criteria. We did not assess follow-up outcome data using GRADE. We contacted trial authors for additional information.

Main results
Main results

We included 33 trials with 36 intervention-control pairs and 1853 participants. The risk of bias present in many studies was unclear due to poor reporting; the evidence has therefore been rated 'moderate' or 'low' when using the GRADE system.

There is low-quality evidence that RTT improves arm function (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.25, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 0.49; 11 studies, number of participants analysed = 749), hand function (SMD 0.25, 95\% CI 0.00 to 0.51; eight studies, number of participants analysed = 619), and lower limb functional measures (SMD 0.29, 95\% CI 0.10 to 0.48; five trials, number of participants analysed = 419).

There is moderate-quality evidence that RTT improves walking distance (mean difference (MD) 34.80, 95\% CI 18.19 to 51.41; nine studies, number of participants analysed = 610) and functional ambulation (SMD 0.35, 95\% CI 0.04 to 0.66; eight studies, number of participants analysed = 525). We found significant differences between groups for both upper-limb (SMD 0.92, 95\% CI 0.58 to 1.26; three studies, number of participants analysed = 153) and lower-limb (SMD 0.34, 95\% CI 0.16 to 0.52; eight studies, number of participants analysed = 471) outcomes up to six months post treatment but not after six months. Effects were not modified by intervention type, dosage of task practice or time since stroke for upper or lower limb. There was insufficient evidence to be certain about the risk of adverse events.

Authors' conclusions
Authors' conclusions

There is low- to moderate-quality evidence that RTT improves upper and lower limb function; improvements were sustained up to six months post treatment. Further research should focus on the type and amount of training, including ways of measuring the number of repetitions actually performed by participants. The definition of RTT will need revisiting prior to further updates of this review in order to ensure it remains clinically meaningful and distinguishable from other interventions.},

SUBJECTS: The subjects were 556 older adults ({$>$} or =65 years of age) who were discharged from physical therapy during the period 2000 to 2003.
METHODS: A survey was developed to determine participation in a HEP. Univariate logistic regressions identified specific barriers and motivators that were associated with exercise participation following discharge from physical therapy.
RESULTS: Ninety percent of respondents reported receiving a HEP; 37\% no longer performed it. Change in health status was the primary reason for poor adherence to a HEP. Eight barriers (no interest, poor health, weather, depression, weakness, fear of falling, shortness of breath, and low outcomes expectation) were associated with a lack of postdischarge participation in exercise.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Exercise adherence following discharge from a physical therapy program is poor among older adults. Barriers, not motivators, appear to predict adherence.},

This article examines the empirical evidence for the existence of Hawthorne effects using the original data from the Hawthorne Relay Assembly Tes Room. Allowing for a variety of other factors, the author assesses whether experimental changes, variously defined, had a common effect that could be regarded as a pure result of the experimentation. The main conclusion is that these data show slender or no evidence of a Hawthorne effect.},

We present different approaches for anthropomorphic and humanlike form in a robot's design related to its physical shape, its behavior, and its interaction with humans. This review provides a comprehensive understanding of anthropomorphism in robotics, collects and reports relevant references, and gives an outlook on anthropomorphic human-robot interaction.},

One of our research goals is to determine how strong and consistent source manipulations tend to be. We find that, on average, source manipulations account for nine percent of explained variance among studies reporting significant findings. In particular, expertise tends to have the greatest effect on persuasion with an average of 16 percent of the explained variance being due to the expert versus non-expert manipulation. As well as gaining insight into the pattern of results across a body of literature, our findings may be used as benchmarks by researchers, as advocated by Sawyer and Ball (1981), to evaluate results of future persuasion studies employing a source manipulation.},

This could include but is not limited to experimental setup, unplanned interactions, or simply the difficulty in transferring theory to the real world.   In order to be able to generalize and compare differences across multiple HRI domains and create common solutions, we are focusing in this workshop on experiences with often used off-the-shelf social robots.  We are interested in identifying the underlying causes of the unexpected HRI results, e.g. the contextual, task, and user related factors that influence interaction with a robot platform. We will furthermore discuss and document (ad hoc) solutions and/or lessons learned such that they can be shared with the HRI community.  As well as sharing specific case studies documenting real world HRI experiences, we further hope to inspire the continued sharing of open and insightful reflections within the HRI community.},

Applying this concept to the domain of Robot Assisted Therapy (RAT) for children with Autistic Spectrum Disorder, a novel methodology is employed to assess the effect of a learning robot on the workload of the human supervisor. A user study shows that controlling a learning robot enables supervisors to achieve similar task performance as with a non-learning robot, but with both fewer interventions and a reduced perception of workload. These results demonstrate the utility of the SPARC concept and its potential effectiveness to reduce load on human WoZ supervisors.},

Abstract
Recent progress in natural language processing has been driven by advances in both model architecture and model pretraining. Transformer architectures have facilitated building higher-capacity models and pretraining has made it possible to effectively utilize this capacity for a wide variety of tasks. Transformers is an open-source library with the goal of opening up these advances to the wider machine learning community. The library consists of carefully engineered state-of-the art Transformer architectures under a unified API. Backing this library is a curated collection of pretrained models made by and available for the community. Transformers is designed to be extensible by researchers, simple for practitioners, and fast and robust in industrial deployments. The library is available at https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.

  abstract  = {Recent progress in natural language processing has been driven by advances in both model architecture and model pretraining. Transformer architectures have facilitated building higher-capacity models and pretraining has made it possible to effectively utilize this capacity for a wide variety of tasks. Transformers is an open-source library with the goal of opening up these advances to the wider machine learning community. The library consists of carefully engineered state-of-the art Transformer architectures under a unified API. Backing this library is a curated collection of pretrained models made by and available for the community. Transformers is designed to be extensible by researchers, simple for practitioners, and fast and robust in industrial deployments. The library is available at https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.},

  abstract  = {We introduce the openSMILE feature extraction toolkit, which unites feature extraction
algorithms from the speech processing and the Music Information Retrieval communities.
Audio low-level descriptors such as CHROMA and CENS features, loudness, Mel-frequency
cepstral coefficients, perceptual linear predictive cepstral coefficients, linear
predictive coefficients, line spectral frequencies, fundamental frequency, and formant
frequencies are supported. Delta regression and various statistical functionals can
be applied to the low-level descriptors. openSMILE is implemented in C++ with no third-party
dependencies for the core functionality. It is fast, runs on Unix and Windows platforms,
and has a modular, component based architecture which makes extensions via plug-ins
easy. It supports on-line incremental processing for all implemented features as well
as off-line and batch processing. Numeric compatibility with future versions is ensured
by means of unit tests. openSMILE can be downloaded from http://opensmile.sourceforge.net/.},

  abstract    = {A major challenge to deploying robots widely is navigation in human-populated environments, commonly referred to as social robot navigation. While the field of social navigation has advanced tremendously in recent years, the fair evaluation of algorithms that tackle social navigation remains hard because it involves not just robotic agents moving in static environments but also dynamic human agents and their perceptions of the appropriateness of robot behavior. In contrast, clear, repeatable, and accessible benchmarks have accelerated progress in fields like computer vision, natural language processing and traditional robot navigation by enabling researchers to fairly compare algorithms, revealing limitations of existing solutions and illuminating promising new directions. We believe the same approach can benefit social navigation. In this paper, we pave the road towards common, widely accessible, and repeatable benchmarking criteria to evaluate social robot navigation. Our contributions include (a) a definition of a socially navigating robot as one that respects the principles of safety, comfort, legibility, politeness, social competency, agent understanding, proactivity, and responsiveness to context, (b) guidelines for the use of metrics, development of scenarios, benchmarks, datasets, and simulators to evaluate social navigation, and (c) a design of a social navigation metrics framework to make it easier to compare results from different simulators, robots and datasets.},
