abstract="The design process of robotic faces as focal points of human-robot interactions plays a very important role in the construction of successful robot companions. The face of a robot represents an attentional anchor for the human user, and, if designed appropriately, enables a comfortable and intuitive communication. In this paper, we describe the user centered design process of the face display of a newly constructed humanoid robot companion called R1. We will introduce a novel solution for robotic face displays, illustrate our design decisions based on the results of an online survey, and present our final face design. We will discuss the lessons learned during the design process and argue that our solution and design will enable R1 to be a successful artificial interlocutor in different human-robot interaction scenarios.",

Our results add to growing evidence that socially assistive robots (SARs) could play a role in addressing patients' low engagement with self-directed exercise programmes. Specifically, we propose how SARs might augment or offer more pro-active assistance over existing technologies such as smartphone applications, computer software and fitness trackers also designed to tackle this issue. In addition, we present a series of design implications for such SARs based on therapists' expert knowledge and best practices extracted from our results. This includes an initial set of SAR requirements and key considerations concerning personalised and adaptive interaction strategies.},

  Abstract                 = {We use a new model of metarepresentational development to predict a cognitive deficit which could explain a crucial component of the social impairment in childhood autism. One of the manifestations of a basic metarepresentational capacity is a [`]theory of mind'. We have reason to believe that autistic children lack such a [`]theory'. If this were so, then they would be unable to impute beliefs to others and to predict their behaviour. This hypothesis was tested using Wimmer and Perner's puppet play paradigm. Normal children and those with Down's syndrome were used as controls for a group of autistic children. Even though the mental age of the autistic children was higher than that of the controls, they alone failed to impute beliefs to others. Thus the dysfunction we have postulated and demonstrated is independent of mental retardation and specific to autism.},

title="Modelling concept prototype competencies using a developmental memory model",
journal="Paladyn",
year="2012",
volume="3",
number="4",
pages="200--208",
abstract="The use of concepts is fundamental to human-level cognition, but there remain a number of open questions as to the structures supporting this competence. Specifically, it has been shown that humans use concept prototypes, a flexible means of representing concepts such that it can be used both for categorisation and for similarity judgements. In the context of autonomous robotic agents, the processes by which such concept functionality could be acquired would be particularly useful, enabling flexible knowledge representation and application. This paper seeks to explore this issue of autonomous concept acquisition. By applying a set of structural and operational principles, that support a wide range of cognitive competencies, within a developmental framework, the intention is to explicitly embed the development of concepts into a wider framework of cognitive processing. Comparison with a benchmark concept modelling system shows that the proposed approach can account for a number of features, namely concept-based classification, and its extension to prototype-like functionality.",

This problem needs to be solved in any robotic system that incorporates a symbolic component. However, it is only recently that the anchoring problem has started to be addressed as a problem per se, and a few general solutions have begun to appear in the literature. This paper introduces the special issue on perceptual anchoring of the Robotics and Autonomous Systems journal. Our goal is to provide a general overview of the anchoring problem, and highlight some of its subtle points.},

  Abstract                 = {Ambient environments which integrate a number of sensing devices and actuators intended for use by human users need to be able to express knowledge about objects, their functions and their properties to assist in the performance of everyday tasks. For this to occur perceptual data must be grounded to symbolic information that in its turn can be used in the communication with the human. For symbolic information to be meaningful it should be part of a rich knowledge base that includes an ontology of concepts and common sense. In this work we present an integration between ResearchCyc and an anchoring framework that mediates the connection between the perceptual information in an intelligent home environment and the reasoning system. Through simple dialogues we validate how objects placed in the home environment are grounded by a network of sensors and made available to a larger KB where reasoning is exploited. This first integration work is a step towards integrating the richness of a KRR system developed over many years in isolation, with a physically embedded intelligent system.},

They don't take other agents into consideration (nothing like perspective taking or rich disambiguation). * No task planning at all (or at least, not discussed in this paper) More in details: - object identification based on viewpoint independent SIFT features - formalized anchoring system that explicitely match percieved attributes to predicates - Cyc predicates - ground 12 colors, based on a paper on color perception. Could be useful for us. - idem, they cite a paper on what spatial relations to compute - location of objects based on a previously provided semantic map (but not much on this semantic map) - two "memories": the robot memory stores the current list of percieved objects ; the archive memory stores what is not percieved anymore - uses directly Cyc (ie, 250 000 common sense concepts...), via CycL language -> 2nd and higher order logics (quantification over predicates, functions, etc) Remark: using 2nd order logic (ie meta statements), it would be easy to store the knowledge of each agent - disambiguation in concept name by asking human to decide amongst all concepts known by Cyc - template based natural language - experiment conducted in a "smart" indoor environmement + simple robot},

In particular, we are developing an extension to the traditional three-layered robot architecture that enables robots to interact directly at each layer -- at the behavioral level, the robots create distributed control loops; at the executive level, they synchronize task execution; at the planning level, they use market-based techniques to assign tasks, form teams, and allocate resources.

Sally leaves and Ann moves the object from the basket to the table. The child is asked: where Sally will look for the object when she will return? The paper explain that children under 4 (as well as autistic children) doesn't answer "on the table" The robot can successfully pass this test if and only if it has an explicit and independent model for Sally believes on the world. So it should work with ORO. But it's a great experiment to set up! - The ToMM-SP model: Leslie proposes a general Theory of Mind Mechanism model based on what he call M-representation. M-representation are made of four components. An (1) agent, an (2) attitude (Leslie names 3 of them: to pretend, to believe or to want), an (3) "aspect of the world that anchors the agent's attitude" and the (4) content of the attitude. The example he takes is a mother that plays and uses a banana as a phone. If correctly understood by the children, this scene can be interpreted as: the (1) mother (2) pretend-true (3) the banana (4) to be a telephone. I would be curious to know your opinion about how feasible it would be to get the robot to actually understand the "mother and banana" scene. In false-belief scenarii (like the Sally-Ann one), the child must be able to attribute a false belief to the agent. Leslie adds to the model ToMM model a Selection Processing (SP) that allows the belief attributer to /inhibit/ the default (true) belief that he/she would tend to attribute to the agent. The whole model looks extremely relevant for us and I think it could be integrated in our current modelling of knowledge.},

  Abstract                 = {GLAIR (Grounded Layered Architecture with Integrated Reasoning) is a multi-layered cognitive architecture for embodied agents operating in real,virtual, or simulated environments containing other agents. The highest layer of the GLAIR Architecture, the Knowledge Layer (KL), contains the beliefs of the agent, and is the layer in which conscious reasoning, planning, and act selection is performed. The lowest layer of the GLAIR Architecture, the Sensori-Actuator Layer (SAL), contains the controllers of the sensors and effectors of the hardware or software robot. Between the KL and the SAL is the Perceptuo-Motor Layer (PML), which grounds the KL symbols in perceptual structures and subconscious actions, contains various registers for providing the agent's sense of situatedness in the environment, and handles translation and communication between the KL and the SAL. The motivation for the development of GLAIR has been "Computational Philosophy", the computational understanding and implementation of human-level intelligent behavior without necessarily being bound by the actual implementation of the human mind. Nevertheless, the approach has been inspired by human psychology and biology.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents an overview of a newly developed Coupled Layer Architecture for Robotic Autonomy (CLARAty), which is designed for improving the modularity of system software while more tightly coupling the interaction of autonomy and controls. First, we frame the problem by briefly reviewing previous work in the field and describing the impediments and constraints that been encountered. Then we describe why a fresh approach to the topic is warranted, and introduce our new two-tiered design as an evolutionary modification of the conventional three-level robotics architecture. The new design features a tight coupling of the planner and executive in one Decision Layer, which interacts with a separate Functional Layer at all levels of system granularity. The Functional Layer is an object-oriented software hierarchy that provides basic capabilities of system operation, resource prediction, state estimation, and status reporting. The Decision Layer utilizes these capabilities of the Functional Layer to achieve goals by expanding, ordering, initiating and terminating activities. Both declarative and procedural planning methods are used in this process. Current efforts are targeted at implementing an initial version of this architecture on our research Mars rover platforms, Rocky 7 and 8. In addition, we are working with the NASA robotics and autonomy communities to expand the scope and participation in this architecture, moving toward a flight implementation in the 2007 time-frame},

  Abstract                 = {This chapter describes recent theory and research in one limited area of social-cognitive development, namely, the childhood acquisition of knowledge about visual perception. The author and his co-workers have hypothesized that there are two developmental levels of such knowledge. At earlier-developing Level 1, the child understands that others as well as the self see objects, and is also able to infer correctly what objects they do or do not currently see if provided with adequate cues. At later-developing Level 2, the child understands not only that people can see objects, but also that they can have differing visual experiences while seeing the same object; most notably, they can have different spatial perspectival views of it when looking at it from different positions. Arguments and evidence for the developmental distinction between Level 1 and Level 2 knowledge are briefly presented in Section I. A more detailed model of Level 1 knowledge is presented in Section II, together with an account of several studies of its development during the first four years of life. During these early years, children appear to learn a great deal about how to produce visual percepts in others (showing and pointing to things), how to deprive others of percepts (hide objects), and how to diagnose the percepts they currently have (follow others' direction of gaze and pointing gestures). Section III similarly reviews recent theory and research on the development of Level 2 perspective-taking knowledge in older children. This work is focused mainly on the acquisition and use of very general perspective-taking rules, such as the rule that two observers who look at an object array from the same spatial position must on that account necessarily have identical perspectival views of the array. Section IV described further developmental research that could be or is being done on Level 2 knowledge, Level 1 knowledge, and on the Level 1-Level 2 distinction.},

The present study is the first to examine the impact of the attribution of mind to others on gaze-guided attentional orienting and its ERP correlates. Using a paradigm in which attention was guided to a location by the gaze of a centrally presented face, we manipulated participants' beliefs about the gazer: gaze behavior was believed to result either from operations of a mind or from a machine. In Experiment 1, beliefs were manipulated by cue identity (human or robot), while in Experiment 2, cue identity (robot) remained identical across conditions and beliefs were manipulated solely via instruction, which was irrelevant to the task. ERP results and behavior showed that participants' attention was guided by gaze only when gaze was believed to be controlled by a human. Specifically, the P1 was more enhanced for validly, relative to invalidly, cued targets only when participants believed the gaze behavior was the result of a mind, rather than of a machine. This shows that sensory gain control can be influenced by higher-order (task-irrelevant) beliefs about the observed scene. We propose a new interdisciplinary model of social attention, which integrates ideas from cognitive and social neuroscience, as well as philosophy in order to provide a framework for understanding a crucial aspect of how humans' beliefs about the observed scene influence sensory processing.},

ABSTRACT={We bridge the gap between two issues in infant development: vocal development and intrinsic motivation. We propose and experimentally test the hypothesis that general mechanisms of intrinsically motivated spontaneous exploration, also called curiosity-driven learning, can self-organize developmental stages during early vocal learning. We introduce a computational model of intrinsically motivated vocal exploration, which allows the learner to autonomously structure its own vocal experiments, and thus its own learning schedule, through a drive to maximize competence progress. This model relies on a physical model of the vocal tract, the auditory system and the agent's motor control as well as vocalizations of social peers. We present computational experiments that show how such a mechanism can explain the adaptive transition from vocal self-exploration with little influence from the speech environment, to a later stage where vocal exploration becomes influenced by vocalizations of peers. Within the initial self-exploration phase, we show that a sequence of vocal production stages self-organizes, and shares properties with data from infant developmental psychology: the vocal learner first discovers how to control phonation, then focuses on vocal variations of unarticulated sounds, and finally automatically discovers and focuses on babbling with articulated proto-syllables. As the vocal learner becomes more proficient at producing complex sounds, imitating vocalizations of peers starts to provide high learning progress explaining an automatic shift from self-exploration to vocal imitation.}

Physical interactions, which are known to be essential for communication with others, also show the effects of eliciting self-disclosure from the people with whom one is interacting and contribute to the construction of social relationships. Previous research demonstrated that people who touched a robot experienced positive impressions of it without clarifying whether being hugged by a robot elicits self-disclosure from people. We developed a huge, teddy-bear-like robot that can give reciprocal hugs to people and experimentally investigated its effects on self-disclosure. Our experiment results with 32 participants showed that those who were hugged by the robot significantly offered more self-disclosure than those who were not hugged by it. Moreover, people who were hugged by the robot interacted with it longer than those who were not hugged by it. On the other hand, the perceived feelings about the robot were not significantly different between the conditions.",

We describe this case study, and how this became a location to articulate and explore four integrated dimensions of responsible innovation: anticipation, reflexivity, inclusion and responsiveness. Although the framework for responsible innovation was designed for use by the UK Research Councils and the scientific communities they support, we argue that it has more general application and relevance."

In this paper I will explore how parallel developments reflect the reasoning in RRI. The focus of the paper will therefore be on the recently published standard on ``Robots and robotic devices: Guide to the ethical design and application of robots and robotic systems'' (BSI 2016). I will analyse the standard and discuss how it can be applied to care robots. The key question to be discussed is whether and to what degree this can be seen as an implementation of RRI in the area of care robotics.",

abstract="As the field of HRI evolves, it is important to understand how users interact with robots over long periods. This paper reviews the current research on long-term interaction between users and social robots. We describe the main features of these robots and highlight the main findings of the existing long-term studies. We also present a set of directions for future research and discuss some open issues that should be addressed in this field.",
