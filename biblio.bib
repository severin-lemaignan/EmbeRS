        societal issues raised by healthcare robotics? This paper argues that
        next to ethical analysis, classic technology assessment, and
        philosophical speculation we need forms of reflection, dialogue, and
        experiment that come, quite literally, much closer to innovation
        practices and contexts of use. The authors discuss a number of ways how
        to achieve that. Informed by their experience with “embedded” ethics in
        technical projects and with various tools and methods of responsible
        research and innovation, the paper identifies “internal” and “external”
        forms of dialogical research and innovation, reflections on the
        possibilities and limitations of these forms of ethical–technological
        innovation, and explores a number of ways how they can be supported by
        policy at national and supranational level."

In this paper we present a framework for understanding and supporting efforts aimed at ‘responsible innovation’. The framework was developed in part through work with one of the first major research projects in the controversial area of geoengineering, funded by the UK Research Councils. We describe this case study, and how this became a location to articulate and explore four integrated dimensions of responsible innovation: anticipation, reflexivity, inclusion and responsiveness. Although the framework for responsible innovation was designed for use by the UK Research Councils and the scientific communities they support, we argue that it has more general application and relevance."

abstract="The concept of responsible research and innovation (RRI) has gained prominence in European research. It has been integrated into the EU's Horizon 2020 research framework as well as a number of individual Member States' research strategies. Elsewhere we have discussed how the idea of RRI can be applied to healthcare robots (Stahl and Coeckelbergh 2016) and we have speculated what such an implementation might look like in social reality (Stahl et al. 2014). In this paper I will explore how parallel developments reflect the reasoning in RRI. The focus of the paper will therefore be on the recently published standard on ``Robots and robotic devices: Guide to the ethical design and application of robots and robotic systems'' (BSI 2016). I will analyse the standard and discuss how it can be applied to care robots. The key question to be discussed is whether and to what degree this can be seen as an implementation of RRI in the area of care robotics.",
