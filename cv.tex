\section{PERSONAL STATEMENT}\label{early-achievements-track-record}

Since I completed my joint PhD in Cognitive Robotics from the CNRS/LAAS (France) and the
Technical University of Munich (Germany), for which I received the \emph{Best
PhD in Robotics 2012} award from French CNRS and the prized \emph{Cumma Summa
Laude} distinction in Germany, I have emerged as a leading authority in
HRI.

Soon after my PhD, I created and successfully led for 2 years the HRI group
within the AI for Learning CHILI Lab at EPFL (Switzerland), supervising in total
10 students, and establishing in a short timeframe CHILI as an internationally
recognised centre in robotics for education. While my original training was in
\textbf{symbolic cognition \& AI for autonomous robotics}, my postdoctoral stay
at the highly cross-disciplinary CHILI Lab gave me the opportunity to become an
expert in \textbf{experimental sciences, socio-psychology and education
sciences}.

I was then awarded an EU \textbf{H2020 Marie Sklodovska-Curie Individual
Fellowship} and I engaged in basic research on artificial cognition: over 2
years, I explored the underpinnings of artificial social cognition. I
\textbf{contributed significantly to the framing of the emerging field of
data-driven HRI}, also releasing of the PInSoRo open dataset
(\href{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1043507}{10.5281/zenodo.1043507}), a
\textbf{one-in-a-kind dataset of natural child-child and child-robot social
interactions}.

%Quickly after the fellowship, I was offered a permanent position
%as lecturer in robotics at Plymouth University, followed as a permanent Senior
%Research Fellow position at the Bristol Robotics Lab.
My current role as a permanent \textbf{Associate Professor in Social Robotics
and AI} at the Bristol Robotics Laboratory (BRL, largest co-located robotic lab
in the UK) recognise my leadership. I am \textbf{in charge of defining and
implementing the lab's research strategy in human-robot interactions}. I created
the Embedded Cognition for Human-Robot Interactions (ECHOS) research group, that
I now co-lead, supervising 15+ PhDs and post-docs. I also supervise the BRL's
Connected Autonomous Vehicles research group (5 students and post-docs).
Specifically, the ECHOS group covers most aspects of situated AI for human-robot
interaction, \textbf{my role includes strategic planning of the group
activities, scientific guidance, recruitment of staff and prospective students,
and grant applications}.

My field of expertise covers \textbf{the socio-cognitive aspects of
human-robot interaction, both from the perspective of the human cognition and
the design and implementation of cognitive architectures for robots}. I have
also focused a significant portion of my \textbf{experimental work on
child-robot interactions in real-world educative settings}, exploring how robots
can support teachers and therapists to develop engaging novel
learning paradigms.

This expertise is recognised internationally: I have a substantial track record
of academic outputs. Since 2008, I have authored or co-authored \textbf{75+ peer-reviewed
publications} in international journals and conferences, leading to \textbf{2500+
citations}, h-index of 25, i10-index of 40 (source: Google Scholar).

I have established strong \textbf{peer recognition} in the field of human-robot interaction
and cognitive robotics. For instance:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]
    \item invited to \textbf{high-profile editorial roles}: Programme Committee member of the HRI
conference since 2015; editor of Frontiers In Robotics and AI journal; editor or
Programme Committee member of several leading conferences in AI and Robotics
        (RSS, IROS, IJCAI, HAI, AAMAS);
    \item invited member of the UK EPSRC Peer Review College;
        invited reviewer for the French, Dutch, Israeli research agencies;
    \item numerous \textbf{invited talks} at national and international symposiums and
        events (9 invited talks since Jan. 2018, including \textbf{keynotes} at the UK Robotics
and Autonomous Systems 2019 conference, and at the 2018 AAAI Fall Symposium);
    \item \textbf{local chair for the high-profile, international HRI2020
        conference} (700+ delegates);
    \item regularly invited to PhD defense committees (most recently at
        LAAS, France, Uni Bielefeld, Germany, and Uni Örebro, Sweden).
\end{itemize}


\vspace{1em} 

I \textbf{actively engage with policy makers, at national and European
level}: for instance, over the past 2 years, I have been directly interacting
(through participating to panels, visits and one-to-one discussions) with the EU
Research Executive Agency (MSCA AI Cluster 2019); the UK minister for Business,
Energy and Industrial Strategy Greg Clark; the UK minister for Universities,
Science, Research and Innovation Chris Skidmore; the chair of the West of
England authority Tim Bowles; the UK Research \& Innovation Portfolio
manager for Robotics Clara Morri.

I have a \textbf{strong track record of tech transfer}, through patenting (US patent
US20190016213A1) and involvement in national and EU-level projects focused on
tech-transfer (InnovateUK ROBOPILOT, CAPRI, CAVForth; EU Terrinet, SABRE).

Finally, I actively engage in \textbf{research communication}: my past research has been
covered several times by mainstream international media, including press
releases by Reuters, Press Association; TV coverage by the BBC, Sky News; radio
interviews and broadcast. My academic website (\url{academia.skadge.org})
showcases this media coverage. I also maintain an active, science-focused,
presence on the social media (Twitter handle: @skadge).
